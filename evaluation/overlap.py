"""Simple text coherence evaluation using words overlap.
Overal local text coherence is measured by evaluation similarity between
consequent sentences.

    coherence(T) = sum_{n-1} sim(Si, Si+1) / (n - 1)

where T - is some arbitrary text, n - number of sentence pairs, sim(Si, Si+1)
- is a measure of similarity between corresponding sentences Si and Si+1.

    sim(S1, S2) = 2 (|words(S1) âˆ© words(S2)|) / (|words(S1)| + |words(S2)|)

We are filtering out all functional words and stem the sentence words before
constructing sets.
