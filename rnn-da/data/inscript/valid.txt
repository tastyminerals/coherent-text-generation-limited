 last month i visited my relatives who live 0 miles away <punct> 
 i did n't want to drive all the way there myself <punct> so i decided one of the best <unk> for me to get there would be to take a train <punct> 
 since i have n't traveled on a train before i did n't know where i should begin <punct> 
 i decided to look online for instructions on what to do <punct> 
 luckily i was able to find all the necessary information to make my trip possible <punct> 
 the next day i drove over to the train station and parked in the secured parking lot <punct> 
 i went over to the ticket booth and paid for a ticket <punct> it cost me around <punct> 0 <punct> 
 i then waited for the train to arrive <punct> 
 once it did i got on board and stored my belongings in the luggage compartment <punct> 
 i then took a seat and relaxed <punct> 
 the train started up <punct> and after a couple of hours i reached my destination <punct> 
 it was an interesting and fun experience <punct> 
 yesterday <punct> i wanted to ride my bike because the weather was so nice <punct> 
 i got my bike out of the storage closet and noticed it had a flat tire <punct> 
 since i do not have a spare tire <punct> i had to fix it if i wanted to ride <punct> 
 i found my bike pump and patch kit <punct> 
 i pumped the tire and was able to locate the air leak <punct> 
 i took out the patch and applied it to the part of the tire that had the little leak <punct> 
 i then pumped the tire again <punct> 
 i had to be careful not to <unk> the tire so the patch would n't pop off <punct> 
 once i was sure the patch would n't come off <punct> i made sure that i pumped the air into the tire sufficiently <punct> 
 i tested the tire by sitting on the bike and riding around a little <punct> 
 the tire seemed to hold <punct> so i was ready to go on my bike ride <punct> 
 it was such a nice day and i had a great day riding my bike <punct> 
 my family recently moved to a new home with a <unk> and boring yard <punct> 
 we decided to plant some trees to <unk> up the place <punct> so my mother <punct> father <punct> siblings and i all packed ourselves into the <unk> and drove to a nearby nursery <punct> 
 we looked at many different types of trees before settling on the apple trees <punct> 
 we bought several baby apple trees and took them home for planting <punct> 
 first <punct> my father and older brother dug large holes in the ground <punct> 
 i wanted to help <punct> but they said i was too young to hold the shovel <punct> 
 after the holes were dug <punct> the apple trees were placed inside <punct> 
 then <punct> we shoveled dirt into the holes to fix the apple trees in place <punct> 
 i was allowed to help with that <punct> thankfully <punct> 
 after all that <punct> our baby apple trees were planted in the ground and we were all very excited to see what they would look like as they grew up <punct> 
 i like taking a bath instead of a shower sometimes <punct> 
 i start by closing the drain at the bottom of the tub <punct> 
 some <unk> have a stopper and some have a thing you push down to close it <punct> 
 after it 's closed i like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then i let the tub fill up to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub <punct> 
 while the water is running <punct> i squirt in bubbles and make sure i have a clean washcloth and towel <punct> 
 after i carefully climb into the tub <punct> i make sure i wash my whole body with the soap and washcloth <punct> even behind my ears and between my toes <punct> 
 then i can either soak and relax in the tub or i can play with toys <punct> 
 fun toys for the bathtub are <unk> and plastic water animals like <unk> and <unk> <punct> 
 once the water starts to turn a little cold <punct> it 's time to get out so i open the drain again and let the water empty out <punct> 
 while it 's draining i carefully stand up and reach for my towel to dry off <punct> 
 i always be sure the tub is clean when i 'm finished <punct> with toys and the dirty washcloth put where they belong <punct> 
 yesterday on my way home from work i heard a loud popping noise and nearly lost control of my bicycle <punct> 
 after coming to a stop i noticed that my tire was flat <punct> 
 i ended up having to walk my bike the rest of the way home as i did not have any tools to repair the tire on the spot <punct> 
 once i returned home i found a can of spray foam that i thought might do the trick if i sprayed it into the tire <punct> 
 i sprayed the foam in and it filled the inside walls of the tire <punct> 
 i was happy with my <unk> <punct> although i knew this was only a temporary fix and i should probably replace the tire <punct> 
 after the tire was filled i hopped on and rode to my local bike shop where i purchased a replacement tire to put on my bike at a later date <punct> 
 this year for vacation <punct> we decide we wanted to to ireland <punct> 
 well never having flown in a plane the thought of flying was a bit <unk> <punct> 
 we scheduled are vacation and our nerves were getting the best of us all since this new to our family <punct> 
 the day arrived that we were to leave <punct> we arrived early since we did n't know how long it would take to get through all the checkpoint i the airport <punct> 
 we checked our bags and got through security and <unk> waited to board our plane <punct> 
 the kids we are anxious to get aboard and see what it was like <punct> i <punct> however was trying to <unk> myself this was going to be a fun experience <punct> 
 we finally got to board the plane <punct> we were directed to our seats by the stewardess and we all sat down and got ready for take-off <punct> 
 the plane engines started to roar and we taxied down the runway <punct> the plane went faster and faster <punct> looking out the window we could see the ground dropping farther and farther away as the plane rose into the air <punct> 
 once we <unk> in the air we realized there was not much to be <unk> for and the excitement set in to see a new country <punct> we were on our way to ireland <punct> 
 <unk> i get my haircut <punct> i have <unk> <unk> <punct> 
 i got a really really bad haircut once and never got over it <punct> 
 when i get a haircut <punct> first i research different haircuts and styles that i might like and <unk> a bunch that i like <punct> 
 then i make my appointment with a <unk> hairstylist <punct> 
 the day of i drive to the hair salon and give my name <punct> 
 i wait while for a bit and then they bring me to the back to wash my hair <punct> 
 once done <punct> i see the hair stylist and i show her my pictures <punct> 
 while she brushes out my washed hair <punct> we make a decision as to what cut and style will look best on me <punct> 
 then she gets to cutting my hair <punct> 
 once she is done cutting <punct> she dries and styles my hair and checks that it is to my liking <punct> 
 small change are made <punct> and then i tip her <punct> pay my bill <punct> and go home <punct> 
 it was a day before last christmas day <punct> 
 our house is filled with <unk> and joy <punct> 
 on every christmas day my wife makes very delicious fruit cake <punct> 
 it is her own recipe <punct> 
 everyone who had tasted the cake before asked her the recipe <punct> 
 we like to have the cake with red wine <punct> 
 she needs a lot of <unk> beforehand to make this cake <punct> 
 she soaked raisins <punct> nuts <punct> and some dried fruits in rum and kept in an <unk> container for 0 days <punct> 
 after 0 days these fruits <unk> rum and <unk> a good flavor <punct> 
 so she usually starts her cake preparation almost 0 days prior to christmas <punct> 
 on christmas <unk> she started baking process <punct> 
 she usually make 0 cakes for us and for some friends <punct> 
 first she prepared <unk> syrup to give the cake that dark color <punct> 
 after that she mixed all purpose flour and baking soda <punct> 
 we need lots of eggs for preparing the cake <punct> 
 i helped her in beating the egg white for cake <punct> 
 after mixing every contents well <punct> she poured the mix into the baking pans and kept it in to the oven and set temperature and time to get it done <punct> 
 when the oven beeped <punct> she took the baking pan out and kept it aside <punct> 
 once it is cooled she packed cakes for friends <punct> 
 then she cut our cake and served it with home made red wine <punct> 
 i can not imagine a christmas without this cake <punct> 
 after having the cake <punct> we went to our friends home and distributed the cakes <punct> 
 i made sure i had my ticket in advance and checked to make sure my flight was not canceled <punct> 
 i had <unk> what i needed and <unk> checked the list to make sure that all my items were approved <punct> 
 then <punct> i arrived at the airport about one and a half hours early <punct> 
 i made sure to go through security first <punct> since there were long lines for that <punct> 
 i had to take off my shoes and put my bags through an x-ray <punct> 
 after i was done <punct> i put my luggage in the correct area so it could be loaded on the plane <punct> 
 i waited until my plane was ready to board and showed the flight attendant my boarding pass <punct> 
 i stayed quietly on the plane and made sure i was in my assigned seat <punct> 
 it can be crowded and boring <punct> so i read my book on the flight <punct> 
 i made sure to listen to the flight attendants when they had an announcement to make <punct> 
 i was riding my bike around my house and noticed i had to <unk> harder than i usually do <punct> 
 i got off my bike to see if everything was wrong <punct> 
 the front tire looked okay <punct> the chain was still on the bike <punct> but the back tire was flat unfortunately <punct> 
 i walked my bike back to my house because it is not safe to ride a bike with a flat tire <punct> 
 i went in my garage and looked for the air pump <punct> 
 i connected the valve of the pump to the valve on the tire <punct> 
 i pumped the air pump and kept checking the tire to make sure it was working <punct> 
 it was hard work and it took longer than i thought <punct> 
 eventually <punct> the tire seemed full with air <punct> 
 i put my ear next to it to see if i could hear any air coming out but i did n't hear any <punct> 
 i got back on my bike and it rode fine <punct> 
 i usually get a haircut every few months to <unk> <punct> 
 i choose a day where i have time to relax and will reserve an appointment at my favorite salon and with my favorite stylist to get my haircut <punct> 
 i arrive at my salon and was greeted nicely <punct> 
 i hang my jacket in their closet <punct> 
 i start my getting a hair wash <punct> 
 i sit and relax as they massage and wash my hair with very fragrant shampoos and <unk> <punct> 
 after the hair wash i go sit in the chair of my favorite stylist <punct> 
 he greets me with a smile and asks me what kind of haircut would i like this time and i had said just a trim <punct> 
 he <unk> my hair dry first and cuts my hair nicely as always and then ends it by styling it with some hair product <punct> 
 i pay the cashier and tip my stylist well <punct> 
 i leave the salon with nice salon hair <punct> 
 my hair had grown quite long <punct> and it was getting more and more difficult to style it as i wanted in the morning <punct> 
 i decided i needed to get a haircut <punct> 
 i called my local salon and made an appointment <punct> 
 luckily they were able to cut my hair the next afternoon <punct> 
 the next day i drove to the salon <punct> and arrived a few minutes before my appointment <punct> 
 i sat in the waiting chairs until my stylist was ready for me <punct> 
 i sat in the large chair <punct> while my stylist put a large cape around my neck and shoulders <punct> 
 this would keep the hair <unk> off of my clothes and from going down my neck <punct> 
 she asked me how i wanted my hair cut <punct> and i told her i just wanted to keep the same style <punct> but with several inches cut off so it would be easier to style <punct> 
 she then leaned my chair back toward the sink <punct> and washed my hair <punct> 
 when she was done <punct> she sat me up and combed my hair out straight <punct> 
 she then took her hair scissors and comb <punct> and carefully combed out and snipped hair off in sections <punct> 
 she combed my hair in between each cut to make sure it was the right length <punct> 
 she went all around my head <punct> alternately cutting and combing <punct> 
 when she was done cutting <punct> she took the hair dryer and blew dry my hair <punct> styling it as she went with a large brush <punct> 
 it felt very nice having someone work on my hair <punct> 
 i felt much lighter and my head did not feel as heavy with my long hair <punct> 
 when we were all done <punct> she removed the cape and shook off all the hair <punct> 
 i looked in the mirror and loved my new haircut <punct> 
 i went to the cashier and paid for my haircut <punct> and left a tip for my stylist as well <punct> since she did a good job <punct> 
 i left the salon very happy with my haircut <punct> 
 i needed to read a book for my history class <punct> so i decided to see if the local library had a copy <punct> 
 i went to the library 's website and searched for the book <punct> 
 i saw that they had it in stock <punct> so i walked to the library <punct> 
 when i entered the library <punct> i walked over to the front desk and told the librarian the name of the book i was looking for <punct> 
 he showed me where the book was and asked me if i 'd like to look for anything else <punct> 
 i said that would be all <punct> so he took the book over to the front desk <punct> and i followed <punct> 
 at the desk <punct> he scanned the book and asked me if i had a library card <punct> 
 i said i did and showed him <punct> 
 he then scanned my card <punct> handed me the book <punct> and told me it would be due back in two weeks <punct> 
 today i got up a little early to get to the library as soon as it opened <punct> 
 it 's about a 0 minute trip <punct> but i love the drive <punct> 
 as i got to the library <punct> the librarian greeted me with a big smile and made small talk <punct> 
 i then looked up the book i wanted on the computer <punct> 
 it was available <punct> and i made my way down the long rows of bookshelves <punct> 
 i found my book easily <punct> and i also found a couple others i 'd like <punct> 
 i carried my stack of books to the counter <punct> and the same librarian was happy to help me <punct> 
 she told me my book choices were great and she also recommended some further reading <punct> 
 she checked out my books in the computer <punct> 
 two of the books needed to be returned in two weeks and the other needed to be returned in one week <punct> 
 i 'll likely return them all in one week <punct> 
 i left and went to the park to start reading <punct> 
 after a long day at work i decided i wanted to take a bath <punct> 
 i went into the bathroom put the plug into the drain and turned the water on in the tub so it would fill with water <punct> 
 then i got undressed and grabbed a towel to use when i was done <punct> 
 i got in the tub and once it was full of hot water i turned off the tap <punct> 
 i got my hair wet and shampooed my hair and applied some conditioner then washed my body using some liquid body wash <punct> 
 i washed the soap off myself and washed the conditioner out of my hair <punct> 
 then i just sat and relaxed in the tub for awhile <punct> 
 when i was ready to get out <punct> i pulled the plug out of the drain <punct> got out and grabbed my towel and dried myself off <punct> 
 then i put on some clean clothes and blow dried my hair <punct> 
 i usually do n't take the bus to work but today i decided to give it a try since the bus stop is right across the street from my house <punct> 
 when the bus came i greeted the bus driver with a friendly hello and paid my bus fare <punct> 
 i was lucky enough to find a seat all the way in the back <punct> 
 there was a lot of different people on the bus <punct> some were kids going to school others were adults going to work like i was <punct> 
 i watched the bus come to a stop every few blocks and drop off a few people <punct> but for every person that left a new person got on <punct> 
 i noticed my stop was near so i pushed the <unk> on the wall that <unk> the bus driver my stop is coming up <punct> 
 when he pulled into the next stop i exited the back of the bus and was happy that after 0 minutes i finally reached my destination <punct> 
 my family and i wanted to take a trip via train across the country <punct> 
 i called a travel agent to set up a time to meet with them and discuss the necessary <unk> <punct> 
 a few days later the appointment arrived and i went to the travel agent 's office to meet with them <punct> 
 after discussing our travel plans we decided that getting a <unk> room on a sleeper car for the family would be the best option <punct> 
 i purchased the tickets and then went home to tell the family we were going and to pack <punct> 
 a week later we arrived at the train station an hour before boarding time to make sure that we did not miss the train <punct> 
 once it was time we boarded the train and found our room <punct> 
 we stowed our luggage and discovered how the beds worked <punct> 
 later it was time to eat and we went to the dining car at our scheduled time far dinner <punct> 
 after which we went back to our room where we did some talking before finally falling asleep <punct> 
 when we woke up we were only an hour from our destination <punct> 
 we had enough time to get changed and pack our things up and before we knew it we were getting off the train <punct> 
 it was a very pleasurable experience <punct> 
 my cousin wanted me to visit him in florida over the summer and i needed to make a plan and book a flight to get there <punct> 
 after searching on the internet for a great price <punct> i found one and booked it <punct> 
 the day of the flight i was a bit nervous as it had been a long time since i had flown on an airplane <punct> 
 i boarded along with the other passengers and realized that i had a great window seat in a good location so i was n't crowded in <punct> 
 after a very smooth take off <punct> the flight attendants brought me something to drink and a snack <punct> 
 it was a very smooth flight and about 0 hours later <punct> i ended up at my destination <punct> 
 it all went very nicely and i was happy to be back on the ground <punct> 
 after we parked at our terminal <punct> we all orderly departed the airplane <punct> 
 after walking down the tunnel <unk> into the airport <punct> i saw my family members waiting for me <punct> 
 it was a very pleasurable experience <punct> 
 i went out to ride my bicycle one morning <punct> only to find that my front tire was very flat <punct> 
 i grabbed my manual air pump and tried to put air into it <punct> but it would not hold any and kept going flat <punct> 
 i heard a hissing sound <punct> so i knew i had punctured the tire somehow <punct> 
 luckily i had a spare inner tube that i could put on <punct> 
 i flipped my bicycle over and took a wrench to remove the tire from the spokes <punct> 
 it was kind of <unk> and messy <punct> but i did n't mind <punct> 
 i was able to get it off pretty easily <punct> 
 i then pushed the tire off of the rim all the way around <punct> 
 when the tire was off the rim <punct> i took the spare tube i had and put it all around the inside of the tire <punct> 
 i then pushed the tire back onto the rim <punct> 
 it did not go on as easily as it came off <punct> and it took a bit of <unk> with the tire to get it back on <punct> 
 finally i had it on <punct> 
 i took my manual air pump and pumped up the tube inside of the tire <punct> 
 it held air very nicely <punct> and i did n't hear any hissing and it did not go flat <punct> 
 i then put the tire back on the front bicycle fork <punct> and tightened the nuts so it would hold very well and not slip or come off <punct> 
 i then flipped my bicycle over and made sure the tire was still holding air <punct> 
 it was <punct> so i put on my helmet <punct> and finally was able to enjoy my morning bike ride <punct> 
 each night after we finish eating our dinner <punct> i go upstairs to take a bath <punct> 
 the first thing that i do is get myself a clean towel and wash cloth <punct> 
 i put these items on the side of the bath tub in my bathroom <punct> 
 i then put the stopper in the drain of the bathtub and turn on the water faucet <punct> 
 i wait for the water to warm up and check it with my hand to make sure it is warm and not too hot <punct> 
 once the bath tub is half way full <punct> i turn off the water <punct> 
 then i take off my clothes and climb into the bath tub <punct> 
 i get my wash cloth and put it under the water <punct> 
 i then get the soap and rub it on my wet wash cloth to make suds <punct> 
 the next thing to do is take the wash cloth and wash my entire body <punct> starting with my face and ending with my toes <punct> 
 after i have washed everything <punct> i rinse the soap from my body with the water in the tub <punct> 
 finally <punct> i get out of the tub <punct> take the stopper out of the drain to let the water out <punct> and use my towel to dry off <punct> 
 after a long day <punct> nothing really relaxes me like a long <punct> soaking bath <punct> 
 the entire activity for me is something i enjoy and start looking forward to before i 've even left work <punct> 
 first i 'll get home and start the tub <punct> i like the water to be hot to the point of nearly scalding <punct> so i only add a tiny bit of cold water <punct> 
 as the tub fills <punct> i get together what i call my bath toys <punct> which <unk> of my kindle and an ice cold beer <punct> 
 when the tub is full i get my favorite sweat pants and <unk> together and <punct> after getting undressed <punct> i slowly lower myself into the tub <punct> <unk> every <unk> as i lower myself into the scalding water <punct> 
 once i 'm settled <punct> i crack open my beer and then just enjoy the feeling of all of the <unk> leaving my muscles as i read <punct> 
 when the water cools off -lrb- this can take 0 minutes or more -rrb- i get out of the tub <punct> dry off and get dressed <punct> but not without a slight feeling of disappointment that the experience has ended <punct> 
 first <punct> i get in the bathroom and make sure that there is a clean towel <punct> 
 if there is not <punct> i go and grab a clean one <punct> 
 then i pull the shower curtain and start the water as hot as it goes <punct> 
 while the water is warming up <punct> and the tub is filling <punct> i brush my hair out <punct> 
 when the tub is filled <punct> i get undressed <punct> pull the curtain back and get in the tub <punct> 
 if i am taking a bath for pleasure <punct> i will put on some enjoyable music and light some candles <punct> 
 if i am sitting in the tub for <unk> i will relax and maybe read a book <punct> 
 if not <punct> i will wet my hair and apply shampoo and rinse it out <punct> 
 then i will apply conditioner and let it sit in my hair <punct> 
 while its sitting <punct> i wash my body with soap <punct> and then <unk> the conditioner <punct> 
 before i leave the tub <punct> i pull the drain and the shower curtain and run the shower to rinse off <punct> 
 i then turn off the shower <punct> and wrap myself in a towel to dry off and my bath is done <punct> 
 yesterday during the day i decided to plant a tree with my friend bob <punct> 
 the first thing that we did was go and buy a little tree from the local walmart <punct> 
 we then went into my backyard and begun to did a hole <punct> 
 we got the hole to about halfway the size we wanted it and decided to take a break for lemonade <punct> 
 next we continued digging <punct> all the while i am <unk> the small part in ensuring an <unk> friendly future <punct> 
 as the sweat <unk> down my face we finish the hole <punct> 
 me and bob gently place the small tree in the hole <punct> 
 now we prepared for the truly fun part <punct> 
 putting back into the ground all the dirt that we had just put there <punct> 
 we filled the hole and then watered my new plant <punct> 
 after we finished me and bob sat back with a beer <unk> this new tree that we had planted <punct> 
 i was about to go for a bicycle ride <punct> but when i went to the garage to get my bike i realized the tire was completely flat <punct> 
 luckily i was prepared for just such an event <punct> 
 i went to a shelf and found my bicycle repair kit <punct> 
 then i took a close look at the bicycle tire <punct> 
 if i could n't find the leak <punct> i could always fill a tub with water <punct> put the tire under the water and see where the bubbles come out <punct> 
 luckily the leak was obvious <punct> 
 i applied some adhesive from the kit and put on a rubber patch <punct> 
 then i got down my bicycle pump <punct> 
 i hooked the hose up to the nipple on the tire and then pumped up and down vigorously for a few minutes <punct> 
 i felt the tire <punct> 
 it was nice and firm <punct> 
 success <punct> 
 i put away the pump and kit and hopped on for my bike ride <punct> 
 i found a beautiful little tree at the local nursery and brought it home to plant in my garden <punct> 
 i had already picked the spot it was to go <punct> a place in the middle of my yard where it could get full sun <punct> 
 after gathering the shovel and watering hose <punct> and putting on my gardening gloves <punct> i set to work on digging the hole <punct> 
 i had to make sure the hole was deep enough to fit its roots comfortably <punct> 
 i dampened the soil in the hole with a little water <punct> 
 once the hole was ready <punct> i laid the tree on its side and gently removed the pot from it <punct> 
 i placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground <punct> then began scraping the soil back into the hole <punct> over the roots <punct> 
 i tamped the soil down <punct> so as to prevent any air pockets <punct> and watered it once more <punct> 
 i think this little tree will make a wonderful addition to my yard <punct> 
 this morning <punct> i went to the grocery store to pick up some food <punct> 
 i got a grocery cart and walked in the store <punct> 
 i looked at the sales that were <unk> in the front of the store <punct> 
 luckily <punct> i saw that carrots were on sale <punct> which was good because i needed to buy carrots <punct> 
 i walked to the produce section and located the carrots <punct> 
 i also picked up some pineapple <punct> oranges <punct> apples <punct> and broccoli from the produce section <punct> 
 i walked over to the dry goods and selected some chicken <unk> soup and spaghetti sauce from the shelf <punct> 
 i remembered that i also needed some milk <punct> so i walked to the refrigerator area <punct> opened the case <punct> and selected <unk> milk <punct> 
 as i was walking to the register <punct> i passed the yogurt and decided to buy a few <unk> of yogurt as well <punct> 
 i walked to the register and waited in line to pay <punct> 
 when i reached the front of the line <punct> i greeted the cashier while she rang up my food items <punct> 
 i gave the cashier the money to purchase my food and left the grocery store with my bags in my hands <punct> 
 it was the <unk> and my hair was getting quite long <punct> as it was down to nearly my <unk> <punct> 
 as a result <punct> i decided it was time for a haircut <punct> 
 after flipping through numerous options <punct> i decided to get a bob hair cut to my <unk> <punct> 
 this was a <unk> change <punct> yet i knew i was ready for it <punct> 
 i left the house and took the drive over to the salon <punct> 
 my favorite hairstylist michelle eagerly greeted me with an excited smile <punct> <punct> 
 <punct> you ready for this <punct> <punct> <punct> 
 she asked me <punct> <punct> 
 <punct> yes <punct> 
 definitely <punct> <punct> <punct> 
 i exclaimed <punct> 
 michelle led me over to a sink as she washed my hair with sweet smelling shampoo <punct> 
 after <unk> my hair quickly <punct> she led me over to her salon chair <punct> 
 she took out her scissors and started cutting <punct> 
 i looked down at the floor at all the hair that flying all over the place <punct> 
 i started to get nervous <punct> <unk> if i made a mistake <punct> 
 by the time she was done cutting and blew dry my hair <punct> i looked back in the mirror <punct> 
 it looked amazing <punct> 
 recently <punct> i traveled to southern california to visit a friend of mine <punct> 
 it was suggested to me to take the train down south as it is cheaper than driving and flying <punct> 
 i looked up the available routes and price on the internet and found a ticket for a fairly cheap price <punct> 
 i purchased it and was very excited at how much money i was <unk> <punct> 
 i packed my ipad and made sure all of my electronic items were charged and drove to the train station <punct> 
 i waited about 0 minutes for the train and carefully boarded it <punct> 
 i stepped on the to the train that was n't very crowded and found a comfortable window seat next to an old man <punct> 
 i stared out the window and read a book on my ipad for most of the trip <punct> 
 it was a very pleasant ride <punct> 
 when we arrived at the destination <punct> i got off of the train and called my friend to pick me up <punct> 
 it was a fun ride <punct> 
 i began to repair my flat bicycle tire by removing the wheel from the bike <punct> 
 this was done by <unk> the brake cable so the wheel would be able to be removed from the frame <punct> 
 i then loosened the bolts holding it on and slid the axle off the frame <punct> making sure that the chain did not get caught or <unk> up while doing so <punct> 
 after the wheel was removed <punct> i made sure that all possible air was out of the tube so that it would be easier to remove <punct> 
 i next took two flat head <unk> and began to remove the tire from the bicycle <punct> 
 after the tire was finally removed <punct> i pulled the tube off the rim as well <punct> 
 next <punct> i placed a new tube in place making sure that the valve stem was placed through the rim appropriately <punct> 
 after doing this <punct> i began to fit the tire to the rim <punct> making sure the tube was placed inside the tire and not <unk> at all <punct> 
 once the tire was on the rim <punct> i inflated the tube <punct> making sure that the tire seated onto the rim properly and that everything held air <punct> 
 finally <punct> i <unk> the wheel onto the bike <punct> and reconnected everything appropriately <punct> 
 <punct> before you board the plane you should consider picking up a bottle of water and a snack in case they do n't have anything you 'd like to drink or eat on the flight <punct> 
 you should also stop at the restroom so <punct> hopefully <punct> you wo n't have to go to the bathroom during the flight <punct> 
 if you have an assigned seat for your flight do n't rush to get on because it 'll just mean sitting there for a longer period of time <punct> 
 once you are ready to board just be patient with everyone else who is flying and with the flight attendants <punct> 
 once you have found your seat store any large items overhead and keep whatever you might want during the flight in the <unk> <punct> 
 i suggest putting your electronic devices there <punct> headphones <punct> books etc. <punct> 
 i also like to make sure to have gum <punct> my snack and my water <unk> available <punct> 
 if you have a smaller item you can put that underneath the seat in front of you <punct> 
 it is a good idea to <unk> gum at least at the start of the flight so you avoid having your ears pop <punct> 
 try to stay <unk> during your flight <punct> and keep your <unk> on whenever you are sitting down <punct> 
 today i decided i wanted to do something special and plant a tree in my back yard <punct> 
 i went to the gardening supply store and bought everything i needed to make this happen <punct> 
 i purchased a shovel <punct> some work gloves <punct> and a small potted tree <punct> 
 when i got back home i quickly went to my backyard to find the perfect spot for the tree <punct> 
 after picking out the spot <punct> i put on my new work gloves to protect my hands <punct> 
 then i got down on my knees <punct> grabbed the small shovel <punct> and started digging a deep enough hole <punct> 
 when i was satisfied with the depth of the hole i removed the small tree from the pot and placed it into the hole <punct> 
 i then covered up the hole with the dirt and made sure it was secure and safe <punct> 
 when i was finished <unk> it <punct> i watered the surrounding area of the tree and admired my handy work <punct> 
 last weekend <punct> i went to keyfood by myself <punct> 
 it 's a grocery store with a good selection of reasonably <unk> items <punct> 
 i had made a grocery list in advance <punct> 
 i drove to keyfood at 0 <punct> 
 i parked in the parking lot <punct> 
 i exited my car and locked it <punct> 
 i walked to the entrance and grabbed a shopping cart <punct> 
 i pushed the shopping cart into the store and began to search for the items on my list <punct> 
 i walked through each isle <punct> 
 i gathered all the items from my grocery list <punct> 
 when i was finished <punct> i pushed my cart to the cashier to pay for my groceries <punct> 
 i placed the items in front of the cashier so that he could account for my purchases <punct> 
 he <unk> my total <punct> 
 i paid the total amount for the groceries and he gave me my change back <punct> 
 finally <punct> i left the grocery store <punct> 
 i enjoy grocery shopping <punct> 
 i stood at the bus stop and consulted the bus timetable <punct> 
 my bus should be there any minute <punct> 
 there were several people waiting with me <punct> 
 we were standing under the shelter <punct> because it had started raining <punct> 
 then i saw the bus arriving <punct> 
 it pulled up to the bus stop and we all stood in line to get on <punct> 
 i said hello to the driver and paid my fare <punct> 
 then i found an empty seat at the back of the bus <punct> 
 i sat down and looked out the window at the city while we drove <punct> 
 there were many stops and people getting off and on <punct> 
 the bus grew so crowded that someone came and sat next to me <punct> 
 i <unk> over to make room and kept looking out the window <punct> 
 finally it was my stop <punct> 
 i said excuse me to the person sitting next to me <punct> and he moved over to let me go by <punct> 
 i stood up and walked off the bus <punct> 
 i had arrived at my location <punct> 
 i decided to bake a cake for my brother 's birthday <punct> 
 he likes chocolate cake the best so i chose a box of double fudge cake for him <punct> 
 it was a cake mix in a box because that 's the easiest way to back a cake <punct> 
 the back of the box said to preheat the oven so i did and then i took out a bowl <punct> a mixer <punct> milk <punct> eggs and oil <punct> 
 i opened the cake box and poured the cake mix into the bowl <punct> 
 then i added two eggs and the amount of milk and oil the back of the box said to use <punct> 
 next i used the mixer to stir it all together <punct> 
 after that i used a little more oil to grease a cake pan <punct> 
 the back of the box also told me which size cake pan to use <punct> 
 once the cake pan was ready <punct> i poured the mixed cake batter into it and smoothed it into the edges then opened the oven to put it inside <punct> 
 i used an oven <unk> on my hand for that part because the oven was hot <punct> 
 once the door was closed again <punct> i set a timer to the right amount of time <punct> according to the back of the box <punct> and then waited <punct> 
 by the time the timer went off <punct> the cake smelled really good and i turned off the oven <punct> then opened it and took the cake out with oven mitts again <punct> 
 then i let it cool on a rack on the counter <punct> 
 when it was cool i opened a container of fudge frosting and spread it all over the cake <punct> 
 i just need to put candles on it and i think my brother will really like it <punct> 
 i was invited to my friend 's <unk> party this weekend and although we were n't asked to bring anything i wanted to bring something <punct> 
 knowing that my friend loves chocolate cake i decided to bake her one <punct> 
 i went to the kitchen and grabbed a large bowl <punct> a whisk <punct> a cake pan <punct> and the ingredients for the cake <punct> 
 i went to preheat the oven and in the meantime i grabbed the bowl and added chocolate cake mix <punct> eggs <punct> milk <punct> and butter <punct> 
 i mixed the ingredients with my whisk until my desired consistency <punct> 
 i buttered the inside of the cake pan then added the cake batter into the pan <punct> 
 once the oven preheated and was ready i put the cake into the oven <punct> 
 an hour later the cake was ready <punct> 
 i let it cool a bit then started to frost the cake with frosting i purchased from the store <punct> 
 i added some strawberries on top for decoration <punct> 
 my friend loved the cake <punct> 
 i had a long day at work <punct> 
 i worked very hard and carried many boxes in the hot weather <punct> 
 my muscles were sore and i thought a hot bath was just what i needed <punct> 
 i got home and lit a few candles <punct> 
 i turned on the hot water <punct> closed the drain in the bathtub and put some bubble bath in there <punct> 
 as the water rose and the bubbles grew <punct> i got out my bath pillow and stuck the <unk> cups to the back of the tub <punct> 
 it <unk> on the water <punct> 
 i also got my favorite book <punct> 
 i turned the water off in the tub <punct> put one foot in at a time <punct> then sank into the hot water and bubbles <punct> 
 i washed my face and laid back <punct> 
 i read my book by <unk> and felt my aches melt away into the hot water <punct> 
 when i was ready to get out of the tub <punct> i opened the drain to let all the water run out <punct> 
 i felt a million times better <punct> 
 recently <punct> i was heading to new york for a business trip with a <unk> <punct> 
 we prefer to ride on trains because they are cheaper and we can enjoy the scenery along the way <punct> 
 we arrive at the train station at 0 am <punct> snacks and <unk> in <unk> in our bags <punct> 
 we purchased our tickets the other day <punct> so we did n't have to worry about going to a booth to buy any <punct> 
 we went up to the attendant who was taking the train tickets to allow people on board <punct> and we handed him <unk> <punct> 
 we hopped onto the train and took our seats towards the back of the train so that we could discuss a lot of what we were going to say and do in the <unk> for our trip without being distracted much <punct> 
 as we discussed our plans and <unk> <punct> we 'd occasionally look out the window and see lush trees and <unk> <punct> animals <punct> <unk> <punct> and all manner of <unk> as we traveled from state to state <punct> 
 we had to switch trains a few times at different stations <punct> but the process was pretty smooth and it is always nice to hear that whistle and the all aboard <punct> 
 when we arrived at our destination <punct> we got off of the train <punct> exited the train station <punct> and made our way to 0 street in our <unk> car <punct> 
 my best friend was having a birthday party in a few days <punct> so i wanted to make her cake that everyone would love <punct> 
 i looked through my book of recipes and found a recipe for chocolate cake that looked delicious <punct> 
 the recipe had a list of ingredients and steps for making the cake <punct> 
 i read the whole thing to make sure i did n't have to go to the store to buy any of the food or cooking supplies needed to make the cake <punct> 
 it said i needed a big bowl <punct> a mixer <punct> a spatula <punct> measuring cups <punct> a pot <punct> and a baking dish <punct> 
 i took each of these out of my cabinets and placed them on the table so they were ready to use <punct> 
 then it said i needed two eggs <punct> flour <punct> sugar <punct> milk <punct> chocolate <punct> and frosting <punct> 
 i took these out of my cabinets and refrigerator so that they were ready as well <punct> 
 once i was sure i had everything i needed <punct> i started reading the instructions again <punct> one by one <punct> 
 on the first step <punct> i had to preheat the oven by turning it to the right temperature early so that it is warm enough to bake when i am ready to put the batter inside <punct> 
 then i had to start making the batter <punct> 
 first i cracked the eggs into the big bowl and threw away the shells <punct> 
 then i used my measuring cups to very carefully scoop the exact amount of flour the recipe asked for and poured it in the bowl <punct> 
 next i measured and poured the sugar and milk the same way <punct> 
 i put the mixer into the bowl and turned it on for a minute <punct> 
 when i turned it off again <punct> i could no longer see each ingredient <punct> and the batter looked like sticky goop instead <punct> 
 the recipe then said to melt the chocolate on the stove in the pot <punct> 
 i put the chocolate in the pot on the stove <punct> turned it on <punct> and watched it turn from solid to liquid <punct> 
 then i poured it into the big bowl and mixed it up again <punct> 
 once i had my chocolate batter <punct> i gently poured it into my baking dish and was ready to put it into the oven <punct> 
 i put on oven mitts to protect my hands from the heat and carefully put the dish into the oven <punct> 
 following the recipe 's instructions <punct> i set the oven timer for an hour and waited for it to bake <punct> 
 once i heard the timer <unk> <punct> i put on the oven mitts again and took the cake out to cool <punct> 
 i turned the oven off and waited for the cake to cool down <punct> 
 the batter was now soft and firm instead of goop <punct> 
 once it was cool <punct> i put it on a plate and spread the frosting all over it with my spatula <punct> 
 finally <punct> the cake was done <punct> 
 it smelled delicious <punct> 
 last week <punct> i was riding my bicycle on a dirt path through the <unk> <punct> 
 the path had many rocks and branches on it and at some point during my ride <punct> i hit a rock and put a hole in the tire <punct> 
 i was forced to walk my bike back to my house and inspect the tires <punct> 
 it seemed to be a minor hole where the rock had <unk> the tire that would require some minor patching <punct> 
 i loaded the bicycle into the back of the car and drove it to our local bike shop where they applied some sort of fill to the hole and patched it up <punct> 
 once completed <punct> my tires <unk> their air pressure and were good as new <punct> 
 i paid the man at the shop and took my bike home <punct> 
 the next day <punct> i took it back out for a ride and all was well <punct> 
 the bike shop was far better <unk> to fix my flat than i was <punct> 
 every sunday i check our pantry <punct> fridge and freezer to see what i need to buy from the grocery store <punct> 
 i also have to check the pet supplies as i have dogs and cats that eat a lot <punct> 
 i carry a piece of paper with me and write down what i need to get <punct> 
 i also have an idea of what meals i intend to cook during the week and what ingredients i will need to make those meals <punct> so i add them to the list <punct> 
 i know which store or stores i am going to visit and i know the <unk> of the store so i try and make my list in the same order that the items will be found once i get there <punct> 
 i pick up a cart on the way into the store and head for the first aisle that i need to visit <punct> 
 most <unk> have their frozen foods at one end so i start at the other end as it is best to buy frozen items last so they do n't start to melt while i 'm walking round the store <punct> 
 i work my way through my shopping list <punct> selecting items off the shelf and placing them into my cart <punct> trying not to <unk> lighter things under heavy things and also making sure i buy items that have a use by date that is later than the day i intend to use them <punct> 
 i am also keeping an <unk> idea of how much everything costs so i have some idea of my total bill <punct> 
 when i am done with everything i wait at a checkout <punct> 
 there is nearly always someone in front of me but the checkout people work fast and i never wait for long <punct> 
 i place all my items on the conveyor belt and the person on the checkout counter scans them for prices <punct> 
 the prices all add up on a screen in front of me so i can see how much i am spending <punct> 
 while the checkout person scans my items another shop assistant packs all my items carefully into bags and places them back in my cart <punct> 
 when i am finished i am always asked if i need any help taking my bags to the car but i always <unk> as i think other people in the store need help more than i do <punct> 
 i load the car and drive home and then have to put everything into the pantry <punct> freezer or refrigerator <punct> 
 that is my least favorite part of grocery shopping <punct> 
 the other night i went grocery shopping and first i drove my car to the store and parked in the parking lot <punct> 
 then i walked into the store and got a shopping cart <punct> 
 i took the shopping cart and began walking down the isles while i looked at my shopping list <punct> 
 i usually write a shopping list when i go to the store to make sure that i do n't forget anything <punct> 
 i grabbed items from many different isles <punct> like grabbing milk from the fridge at the back of the store and some cheese in the isle next to that <punct> 
 once i got everything on my list i took the shopping cart and wheeled it over to the line for the checkout counter and my items are scanned and go down the belt to be bagged <punct> 
 finally a bagger bags my groceries and i put them in my cart and out the door of the grocery store and put the grocery bags in my car and put the cart away in the designated shopping cart drop off point <punct> 
 yesterday i went grocery shopping <punct> 
 before i left the house <punct> i made sure i had my shopping list <punct> my wallet <punct> and my reusable shopping bags with me <punct> 
 i then walked to my local grocery store <punct> 
 when i entered the store <punct> i picked up a shopping basket near the entrance <punct> 
 i then looked at my shopping list to see what i needed to buy <punct> 
 i walked through the aisles <punct> selecting the items i had written on my shopping list and placing them in my shopping basket <punct> 
 when i had everything i needed <punct> i lined up at the checkout <punct> 
 when it was my turn <punct> i handed my shopping basket and my reusable shopping bags to the lady working at the checkout <punct> 
 she scanned my items <punct> and another man placed all my items in my shopping bags <punct> 
 when everything had been scanned <punct> the lady told me how much my groceries cost <punct> and i handed her the correct amount of money <punct> 
 i then picked up my bags and left the store <punct> 
 when i was very young <punct> my family only just recently got our new home <punct> 
 the backyard had no trees and little decoration but that soon changed over the years <punct> 
 about a year after we moved in <punct> my dad decided it was time we planted a tree in the backyard and i was able to help <punct> 
 i had no idea what type of tree it would be and when i asked my dad just said i 'd have to wait and find out <punct> 
 i would n't know it but several years later the tree would be larger than the house itself <punct> 
 to get things started <punct> i dug up a small hole to plant the tree <punct> 
 my dad had to make sure the hole was just the right size <punct> 
 once the space was perfect <punct> i carefully placed the very young tree into it 's new home and covered the roots up with dirt <punct> 
 after it was firmly set in place <punct> i watered the tree and was done for the day <punct> 
 every year we celebrate arbor day <punct> 
 last year we we decided to celebrate the holiday by <unk> a tree <punct> 
 we went to the local plant nursery <punct> 
 we talked to the employees to find out which trees grow well in our area and in the type of soil we have <punct> 
 we chose a small maple seedling <punct> 
 when we got home <punct> we chose an area of our yard with lots of sun <punct> 
 we dug a hole just a little bigger than the roots of our seedling <punct> 
 we put the seedling in the hole in the ground very carefully <punct> then covered the roots with dirt <punct> 
 we patted the dirt down really good to make sure the little tree seedling would be stable in the ground when it was windy <punct> 
 then we watered the tree <punct> 
 we 've been watching and watering our tree for a year and slowly but <unk> our little tree is growing <punct> 
 my husband and i went to the nursery to look at trees <punct> 
 we wanted to plant a tree in the front yard <punct> but we were n't sure what to get yet <punct> 
 we wandered through the nursery and considered a few of our option <punct> 
 we did n't want a large tree <punct> like a pine tree <punct> 
 we did n't want a small tree <punct> like a japanese maple <punct> 
 we wanted something <unk> <punct> 
 when we spoke to one of the workers at the nursery <punct> he suggested that we plant a <unk> <punct> 
 it would have green leaves <punct> and would have white flowers in the spring <punct> 
 we took the tree home in the back of our truck <punct> 
 my husband used our shovel to dig a hole in the ground <punct> 
 it took him some time <punct> you have to dig a pretty big hole when you plant a tree <punct> 
 then i helped him carry the tree over to the hole <punct> 
 we had to cut off the plastic bucket it was in <punct> 
 when we were done <punct> we put it in the hole <punct> and i helped by holding the tree steady and pushing dirt into the hole <punct> 
 once we had filled in all the dirt around the tree <punct> we turned on the sprinklers <punct> 
 we wanted to water the tree and get it off to a good start <punct> 
 we were excited to have a new tree in the front yard <punct> 
 if you want to plant a tree it is best to get a small sapling <punct> 
 dig yourself a hole and put the saplings root ball in the hole <punct> 
 you do not want to cut or break the roots when you put it in the ground <punct> 
 make sure your hole is big enough but not too deep <punct> 
 you also do not want your hole to be too narrow <punct> 
 you can remove any dead or dried up roots from the ball <punct> 
 you now want to refill with dirt lightly <unk> the dirt as you go <punct> 
 make a mound of dirt around the base of the tree with the dirt that no longer fits in the hole <punct> 
 water the tree <punct> 
 it is a good idea to also add some sort of mulch to protect the dirt from washing away <punct> 
 this will also help keep weeds from growing and help in keeping moisture to roots <punct> 
 fertilize and water your newly planted tree <punct> 
 as an avid mountain <unk> <punct> i have found myself in many precarious situations <punct> 
 from run <unk> with <unk> <punct> to falling into <unk> bushes <punct> 
 it is always an adventure when you are riding your mountain bike through the great outdoors <punct> 
 one particular issue that affects all mountain bikers <punct> is flat tires <punct> 
 i have had numerous flat tires during my years riding <punct> 
 the first flat tire i ever had left me <unk> miles away form <unk> <punct> 
 i had to <unk> it out on foot <punct> carrying a broken bike <punct> 
 it was an experience i did not want to <unk> again <punct> 
 from then on i purchased and kept many bicycle tire tubes in my riding gear <punct> 
 to replace a bicycle tire is now a simple process for me <punct> 
 you break the <unk> on the old tire shell and pull it slightly to the side <punct> 
 you work the tube out from between the rim and the tire itself <punct> 
 you then stuff the new rubber tube where the old one was <punct> making sure the nipple matches with the nipple hole <punct> 
 you then move the outer tire back into position and pump up the tire <punct> 
 i decided we needed some fruit trees on our property so ordered a three in one apple tree from a catalog <punct> 
 the three in one apple tree did n't need other apple trees for cross <unk> because it had three different kinds of apples on its branches <punct> 
 a couple weeks later a the apple tree came in the mail <punct> 
 i opened the package and read the directions <punct> 
 i then grabbed a shovel and went and dug a hole that was twice as big as the base of the tree <punct> 
 then i drove to the store to buy some potting mix which was highly <unk> in the apple trees instructions <punct> 
 once home <punct> i put the three in one apple tree into the hole i had dug <punct> 
 then i put potting soil around the base of the tree <punct> 
 then all that was left to do was keep it watered throughout the year <punct> 
 the night before i take a train ride <punct> i look at the train schedule <punct> 
 usually i am going to new york city <punct> so i check the train schedules for the trains heading there <punct> 
 when my husband and i take the train <punct> we go early <punct> so that morning i wake up early and get ready for the day <punct> 
 we then drive to the train station and park our car <punct> 
 depending on which train station we are going to <punct> the parking is free <punct> but otherwise we pay for our parking <punct> 
 once parked <punct> we walk to the platform and buy our tickets at the automated teller <punct> 
 then we wait for the train to arrive <punct> 
 when the train arrives <punct> we find a good place to sit <punct> 
 we try to sit where there are n't too many people and where there are only 0 seats so that we do n't have to sit with strangers <punct> 
 then the train takes off and we usually are on the train for an hour before we get to our destination <punct> 
 i needed to learn about gardening and was n't sure where to start <punct> 
 a friend of mine recommended a book <punct> 
 i decided to check it out from the local library <punct> 
 i walked to the library <punct> 
 inside there was a computer to look up where books are located <punct> 
 i typed in the name of the book i was looking for and it showed me the call number <punct> a unique number used to tell where the book is located in the library <punct> 
 i wrote the call number down and looked at the stacks of books <punct> 
 each stack had a range of numbers printed on a card <unk> to the side of the <unk> <punct> 
 i looked for my call number on the printed cards on the side of the bookshelves <punct> then searched the books until i found the one i was looking for <punct> 
 i brought the book up to the front of the library <punct> 
 the librarian took my library card and scanned it and my book with a special scanner <punct> 
 she gave me a piece of paper inside the book that said i needed to bring it back within 0 weeks <punct> 
 i brought the book home and read it <punct> then brought it back to the librarian <punct> 
 when i was riding my bike this past summer <punct> one of my tires went flat <punct> 
 i noticed it went flat because it felt bumpy while i was riding down the street <punct> 
 i wheeled my bike home while walking next to it and pushing it <punct> 
 i asked my dad to help me fix the flat tire because i had never done it before <punct> 
 he gave me the materials i needed to fix it <punct> and he explained how to go about fixing it <punct> 
 to my surprise <punct> it was very easy to fix the flat tire <punct> 
 i just had to patch up the hole with the materials he gave me <punct> 
 after i patched up the hole <punct> i used an air pump to put air in both of my tires <punct> 
 this completed the repair process for me <punct> 
 the next day <punct> i rode my bike again and i did not have any problems with the tire <punct> 
 i decided i really wanted to bake a cake so i hopped into the car and drove to the grocery store <punct> 
 i bought flour <punct> sugar <punct> eggs <punct> and some cocoa <punct> 
 all the other ingredients i had at home already <punct> 
 once i got home i got out my big mixing bowl and measuring cups and spoons <punct> 
 i pre-heated the oven to 0 degrees and started pouring ingredients into the mixing bowl <punct> 
 after all the ingredients were mixed <punct> i greased a cake pan and poured in the batter <punct> 
 i put the pan in the oven and started mixing the ingredients for the frosting in a new bowl <punct> 
 after baking for a while <punct> i took the cake out and stuck in a toothpick to make sure the center was done <punct> 
 i let the cake cool for a bit and then put the frosting on it <punct> 
 after frosting went on <punct> i cut it into pieces and put one on a plate for myself and another for my friend <punct> 
 last winter <punct> my husband and i took the train to chicago <punct> 
 before the train trip <punct> we had to check the train schedule to find out what choices we had about when we could leave <punct> 
 we found the train schedule on the world wide web <punct> 
 after we learned that there were two trains a day <punct> we decided to take the morning train departing at 0 <unk> <punct> 
 we purchased our tickets by paying with a credit card using the amtrak web site <punct> 
 after we paid for our tickets <punct> they were emailed to us <punct> and then we printed them <punct> 
 on the day of our trip <punct> we drove our car to the train station <punct> which is about 0 miles away from our house <punct> 
 we parked at the station <punct> and because it 's a little train station instead of a big city <punct> we did n't have to pay for parking <punct> 
 we took our suitcases and went to the platform <punct> where other people were waiting <punct> 
 eventually -lrb- a little late -rrb- <punct> the train pulled in <punct> 
 there were already passengers on the train from other stops <punct> 
 we boarded the train and found two seats near each other <punct> 
 throughout the train trip <punct> we chatted with each other <punct> and we also talked to one of the other passengers <punct> who was confused about the train <unk> up <punct> 
 we explained to him that sometimes they have to do that at the stations <punct> and it was nothing to be <unk> about <punct> 
 the train pulled into the station at chicago about 0 minutes late <punct> which is very typical in chicago <punct> 
 we got off the train and were happy to stretch our legs <punct> 
 my yard was very bare and <unk> so i decided to add some trees to the landscape <punct> 
 first <punct> i went to the local nursery and asked them for advice on what kinds of trees would do well in my area <punct> level of sunlight <punct> amount of <unk> <punct> etc <punct> 
 they gave me some ideas and i picked out a <unk> <unk> tree sapling <punct> 
 i took it home and left it in shade while i prepared to plant it <punct> 
 first i got out a shovel and dug a deep enough hole to cover the whole root ball of the tree <punct> 
 then i placed some fertilizer in the bottom of the hole <punct> 
 next i unwrapped the root ball from the burlap sack which contained it and placed it in the hole that i had dug <punct> 
 once it was in <punct> i shoveled the dirt back into the opening and tamped it firmly around the base of the tree <punct> 
 after that i placed a <unk> hose near it to give it plenty of water <punct> 
 my car is in the repair shop so i had to take the bus to work yesterday <punct> 
 the first thing i did was walk to the bus stop at the corner and then waited for the bus to arrive <punct> 
 i watched the signs on the front of the buses as they approached so i would know which one to take <punct> 
 when i saw the right one <punct> i stood up so the driver would know i want to ride <punct> 
 the bus stopped and then the door opened <punct> 
 i climbed the steps and the bus driver said hello <punct> 
 you can buy a bus pass if you ride the bus a lot <punct> but i do n't so i do n't have a pass <punct> 
 instead <punct> i put coins into the money <unk> beside the bus driver and then i walked to where the seats are <punct> 
 the bus was only about half full <punct> so i chose a seat by myself and sat down by the window <punct> 
 once the bus started again <punct> there was a little <unk> motion as it moved forward and then we were rolling down the street <punct> 
 while i was sitting <punct> i did n't touch anything in case it was dirty <punct> 
 instead <punct> i kept my hands in my lap and watched people <punct> cars and buildings out of the window <punct> 
 a nice lady in the seat across from me smiled at me <punct> but no one else paid attention to me and when the bus stopped i got up along with several other people and climbed down to the street again <punct> 
 i wanted to visit my family that lived far away for christmas <punct> 
 i knew that it was too far for me to drive <punct> so i decided to fly <punct> 
 i went online and searched for tickets <punct> 
 i found a ticket that was the cheapest with the <unk> <unk> <punct> because i wanted to spend as little time as possible traveling on my trip to my family 's house <punct> 
 i brought my ticket to the airport on the day that i was to depart <punct> 
 i went to the gate of the airline that i was flying and handed in my ticket <punct> 
 i waited in the airport until the plane was ready to be boarded <punct> 
 i got in line and boarded the plane <punct> 
 i found a seat and buckled my seat belt <punct> 
 it took a couple hours of flying until we landed <punct> 
 i got off of the plane and met up with my family in the airport <punct> 
 in the late spring <punct> i bought a beautiful little tree from a nursery <punct> 
 the workers there helped me find a type of tree that would grow tall and give good shade in the summer <punct> 
 when i went home <punct> i thought about the best place in my backyard to put the tree <punct> 
 the tree 's roots were tied up in a little bag with some potting soil to give it water and nutrients for a little while <punct> but it had to be put in the ground soon to keep it healthy <punct> 
 i went to my garden shed and got some tools so i could plant it as soon as possible <punct> 
 first i got a big wheelbarrow to help me carry everything i needed <punct> 
 in the wheelbarrow <punct> i put the little tree <punct> a shovel <punct> a big watering can <punct> and a garden rake <punct> 
 then i pushed it to the spot in my yard that i wanted to put the tree <punct> 
 i took the tree and all the tools out of the wheelbarrow <punct> except for the shovel <punct> 
 then i pushed my wheelbarrow to my compost bin at the other side of my garden <punct> 
 i one by one <punct> i scooped a shovelful of compost into my wheelbarrow until there was enough to fill a couple of buckets <punct> 
 the compost would help the tree get a head start on growing tall and healthy <punct> 
 i pushed the wheelbarrow back to where i wanted to plant the tree <punct> 
 next <punct> i had to dig a hole so the tree would be secure in the ground <punct> 
 i stuck the tip of the shovel in the ground and pushed down hard on it with my foot <punct> 
 the ground gave way <punct> and i was able to scoop the dirt out of the way <punct> 
 i did this until i had a round hole over two feet deep <punct> 
 i put the tree in the hole <punct> but it would not stand up straight <punct> and instead leaned on one side of the hole <punct> 
 i slowly scooped compost and dirt into the hole <punct> carefully <unk> the tree to stand upright again after each shovelful <punct> 
 i patted the earth down to keep it compact <punct> 
 after a lot of hard work <punct> the hole was finally filled with dirt and compost <punct> and the tree was standing upright and strong <punct> 
 i smoothed over the dirt and compost with my garden rake <punct> then filled up the watering can with water from a hose <punct> 
 i slowly poured the water over the freshly <unk> dirt <punct> letting the water soak into the ground <punct> 
 the tree was planted and ready to grow <punct> 
 my car had broken down so i needed to take the public bus to work on wednesday morning <punct> 
 first i looked on-line to see which bus i should take to get to <unk> <punct> and what bus stop was the closest to my home <punct> 
 the instructions were to go to seven <unk> shopping center <punct> catch the 0 to tyson corner <punct> and then transfer to the 0 to get within a block of my office <punct> 
 in the morning i walked up to the shopping center and waited until the bus came <punct> 
 i got on <punct> paying the driver with change and dollar bills <punct> 
 i confirmed with the driver that this was the correct bus to go to tyson corner and transfer <punct> 
 i chose a seat near the front so i could make sure i did not miss my next stop <punct> 
 i transferred at tyson corner to the 0 <punct> which took me within a block of my work place <punct> 
 i wanted to take a trip on a train <punct> 
 i thought it would be fun to travel through the countryside <punct> 
 i called the train <unk> and booked a ticket for a country journey day trip <punct> 
 i arrived at the train station <punct> full of excitement <punct> 
 i handed my ticket to the conductor <punct> 
 i found my seat which was near a window <punct> so i would be able to take in all the sights as the train traveled along <punct> 
 after the train car was filled <punct> the conductor told us that we would be departing on our journey and when we would arrive at our destination <punct> 
 the train lurched forward with a mighty <unk> and began to <unk> along <punct> 
 i could hear the wheels <unk> across the tracks as i enjoyed the lovely scenery that was passing by <punct> 
 when we arrived at the destination <punct> we approached the station and the train <unk> to a stop <punct> 
 i exited the train filled with wonderful <unk> about my experience <punct> 
 the other day <punct> i decided to ride the bus to work since my car had broken down <punct> 
 it was a cold day in <unk> as the rain had just fallen the night before <punct> 
 i sat nearby the <unk> of the bus and felt he <unk> blowing onto my neck and watched the street signs to see how much further my stop was going to be <punct> 
 i had been riding on the bus for approximately 0 minutes and stopped three times so far <punct> 
 we came upon a busy intersection where the bus stop was crowded with what appeared to be fifteen or so people huddled by the bench area waiting to get on <punct> 
 slowly the people in queue walked onto the bus steps and piled into each available space as quickly as they could <punct> 
 after driving for two more blocks <punct> i noticed my stop and pressed the button to signal the driver to drop me off <punct> 
 i stood up from my seat and headed to the door and left to go to work <punct> 
 baking a cake and be fun and eating the cake even more fun <punct> 
 i have made cakes homemade from scratch using a recipe from my mom <punct> 
 but most of the cakes i have made have been from a box mix <punct> 
 i recently made myself a birthday cake <punct> 
 i made a german chocolate cake and it was delicious <punct> 
 most box mixed call for a couple eggs and water <punct> 
 sometimes you have to add oil also <punct> 
 the german chocolate cake i made called for oil and i used coconut oil <punct> 
 when you bake a cake you always have to oil and flour the cake pan so it does not stick <punct> 
 i used two round cake pans for my birthday cake but i have often used a square pan or a bunt pan <punct> 
 after taking a cake out of the oven you need to let it cool <punct> 
 i was eager for my birthday cake to cool so i could frost it <punct> 
 german chocolate cake typically has a coconut and <unk> frosting and this is what i used <punct> 
 i needed to go grocery shopping <punct> 
 i drove to the grocery store and got the list from my purse <punct> 
 i walked into the front door and was greeted by the cashiers <punct> 
 i went to the buggy area and got a large grocery cart <punct> 
 i proceeded down the produce aisle <punct> making items off my list as i added them to my shopping cart <punct> 
 i then went to the meat department and asked the butcher to package some cuts of meat for me <punct> 
 after that i went to the dairy department and picked up some eggs <punct> milk and butter <punct> 
 i proceeded to the check out area and waited in line <punct> 
 i placed my items on the conveyor belt as the cashier scanned them <punct> 
 after all my items were scanned <punct> the cashier gave my my total <punct> 
 i gave her exact cash and proceeded to my car to place the groceries into my trunk <punct> 
 borrowing a book from the library is so nice and super simple to do <punct> 
 i love doing this because if you want to read a book and not buy it <punct> then just go borrow it from the library <punct> 
 almost every library will add new books to their collection if you ask <punct> 
 you just need a library card and you can get one from any library since they are free if you have a picture id card of yourself and an address where you <unk> <punct> 
 if you know what type of book you want <punct> you can go to the section of the library that has that category or you can ask a librarian to help you <punct> 
 if you ask politely where a certain book is <punct> they are more than happy to help you find the book <punct> 
 so once you find the book you are looking for <punct> you take it to the checkout desk and present them with your library card <punct> then they punch the card into their computer system and scan the barcode on the book so they have a record of who has what book <punct> 
 they then tell you when the book is due <punct> and for the next designated time frame <punct> you can spend your time enjoying the book you are borrowing from the library <punct> 
 i go to the library just about every day and find a good book to read and i sit outside and read it <punct> 
 i went and got the <unk> book and started reading it today in the library <punct> 
 i had to ask the librarian where to find it in the library since it was not where i thought it would be <punct> she kindly helped me find it and asked what types of books that i enjoy reading and suggested some for me to check out after i finish this one and then i went on my way to dive into this book and enjoy the story since i saw the movie last week <punct> 
 i was going to meet up with my friends at the mall to watch a new movie that recently came out <punct> 
 but <punct> since the mall is pretty far away <punct> i needed to take the bus <punct> 
 so <punct> i went online to the bus <punct> site to check the time that the mall route bus would be near my house <punct> 
 i marked the times down on my phone and got ready to leave <punct> 
 i sent a <unk> to my friends and let them know that i could make it and that i 'd been there soon <punct> 
 i grabbed my jacket <punct> wallet <punct> and made sure to get my bus pass <punct> 
 i checked the time and set off <punct> 
 i walked a few blocks to the bus stop and double checked the time <punct> 
 i had to wait for a little bit <punct> but it 's always better to get to the stop early <punct> since sometimes the bus is n't quite on schedule <punct> 
 the bus finally pulled up and i got on <punct> 
 i swiped my card and i found a decent seat <punct> 
 luckily <punct> there were n't that many people on board and the stops were short <punct> 
 as the bus got closer to the mall <punct> and it was nearing the stop <punct> i pulled on the line that let the driver know that she needed to let someone off <punct> 
 i made it to the mall in good time and got to hang out with my friends a bit before the movie <punct> 
 it was a pretty good day <punct> 
 for christmas last year <punct> my family had a very big get together and everyone was <unk> with making and\/or bringing a food item <punct> 
 i did n't know what to bring <punct> so i simply asked my aunt what she would like <punct> 
 she told me that she would love a cake <punct> as there was a <unk> of people bringing dessert <punct> 
 i figured that i should bake it myself since i do not bake fairly often <punct> 
 i looked throughout my pantry and realized i had everything i needed <punct> 
 i went ahead and made it the evening before using all of the ingredients <punct> 
 i mixed the flour <punct> sugar <punct> water <punct> eggs and even made my own frosting and did n't use one from a can <punct> 
 it turned out very moist <punct> sweet and very good tasting <punct> 
 the next day i brought the cake over to my family gathering and it was a big hit <punct> 
 everyone seemed to enjoy it <punct> 
 afterwards <punct> my aunt and other family members thanked me very much <punct> 
 i was very happy with myself <punct> 
 while looking for something to eat in our home <punct> my wife and i decided it was time to go grocery shopping <punct> 
 first <punct> we decided to take <unk> on everything we had in the house <punct> to see if we 'd need to buy more of it in our trip to the grocery store <punct> 
 after that <punct> we made a list of things we need and want <punct> 
 after that we drove to the grocery store and got a cart <punct> 
 we walked around the grocery store <punct> getting everything that we put on our list <punct> 
 after <punct> we still had some extra spending money and decided to get some extra things <punct> 
 she was pregnant so she <unk> weird things <punct> 
 we got plenty of <unk> <punct> 
 when we were done picking everything <punct> we headed towards the cash registers to check out <punct> 
 we got everything scanned and handed the cashier the money to pay for everything <punct> 
 after that <punct> we went home and put everything where it belongs <punct> 
 this morning <punct> my sister decided to bake a cake for her friend who was visiting from out of town <punct> 
 so <punct> after stopping by the grocery store to buy some sugar <punct> she gathered all of the ingredients and cooking utensils <punct> she needed in her kitchen <punct> 
 she got butter <punct> flour <punct> cocoa powder <punct> salt <punct> baking powder <punct> eggs <punct> vanilla <punct> and some buttermilk <punct> 
 next <punct> she preheated her oven to 0 degrees and greased her round baking pan with the butter <punct> 
 she then mixed all of the wet ingredients such as the eggs <punct> vanilla <punct> and buttermilk in a mixing bowl <punct> 
 for the dry ingredients like the flour <punct> she mixed them separately in another <punct> smaller bowl <punct> where they were stirred together <punct> 
 once this was done <punct> the dry mixture was combined with the wet mixture and then they were were thoroughly stirred together <punct> 
 my sister then used a spatula to make sure all of the batter poured into the baking pan <punct> 
 after which <punct> the pan was placed in the over for half an hour <punct> 
 when the cake was ready <punct> she took the cake and set it on her kitchen counter to cool off for a few minutes <punct> 
 finally <punct> she placed it onto a plate and carefully put on some chocolate <unk> frosting <punct> 
 the cake was now ready for her friend to enjoy once she arrived <punct> 
 books are <unk> tools that bring you on wonderful adventures <punct> 
 everyone should read as many as they possibly can <punct> 
 the best way to do so is to borrow a book from the library <punct> 
 when i borrow a book from the library <punct> i first obtained a library card <punct> 
 i did this by going to my local library <punct> and speaking with a librarian <punct> there i created an account with my name <punct> 
 following this <punct> and following the successful <unk> of my <unk> card <punct> i began my search for a book <punct> 
 in the old days i would need to use a card catalog <punct> these days i can search through books on a library computer <punct> 
 i search through many genres and types of books before making my decision <punct> 
 i then write down the number of the book and begin my search <punct> 
 i find the matching bookshelves and then find the matching book number <punct> 
 book in hand <punct> i <unk> skip to the checkout <punct> and check my book out with the librarian <punct> making sure to note the time which i need to return the book <punct> 
 it was a sunny afternoon so my friend and i went decided to go for a ride on our bicycles in the woods <punct> 
 i did n't check the air pressure beforehand and thought it would be okay <punct> 
 as we were riding through the trails in the woods the <unk> was more rough than i had expected and the the tire went flat <punct> 
 i got off my bicycle and <unk> down to check the condition of the tire to see if there were any <unk> <punct> 
 there were n't any and it was just out of air <punct> 
 it was a good thing my friend packed an air pump <punct> 
 i stuck the needle from the air pump into the tire and started to pump air <punct> 
 the bicycle tire started to inflate and it was good as new <punct> 
 i packed the air pump and handed it back to my friend and continued our bicycle adventure in the woods <punct> 
 i decided to bake a special cake for my mother 's birthday <punct> 
 i gathered ingredients from my pantry that i had purchased earlier in the week <punct> 
 i turned on the oven to let it preheat before starting to combine ingredients <punct> 
 i took out a huge metal bowl from the cabinet <punct> along with a wooden spoon and mixer to help mix the ingredients <punct> 
 i put eggs <punct> flour <punct> sugar <punct> cocoa powder <punct> and butter into the metal bowl and mixed it with the electric mixer <punct> 
 then <punct> i took out a food processor from the cabinet along with a carton of raspberries from the fridge <punct> 
 i dumped all of the raspberries into the food processor along with a few <unk> of water and then turned it on <punct> 
 i watched the raspberries become a smooth liquid <punct> 
 i poured the liquid into the big bowl with the rest of the ingredients <punct> 
 i took out a square pan and greased it with the butter wrapper <punct> and then put a light dusting of flour on the pan <punct> 
 next <punct> i poured the cake batter in the square pan and it was just enough <punct> 
 i put the pan into the oven and after about an hour <punct> the cake was finished baking perfectly <punct> 
 i turned the oven off <punct> and waited for the cake to cool for a few minutes <punct> 
 then <punct> i spread a jar of chocolate icing around the cake while it was still in the pan <punct> 
 i put it into the fridge and waited for my mother to get home <punct> 
 in <unk> 0 <punct> i rode and flew in an airplane on my way back home from my parents <punct> country of birth <punct> the <unk> <punct> 
 i rode two different planes <punct> but this one will be about the second one <punct> the trip on the way back to the united states <punct> 
 i was in <unk> international airport and boarding my second flight <punct> 
 i forgot which airline it was <punct> 
 but like one would normally do <punct> i waited in line <punct> showed the boarding attendant my ticket and passport <punct> and headed to the tunnel connecting the building and the plane <punct> 
 as i headed for my seat <punct> i tried looking at the seat numbers on the compartments above them <punct> 
 i found mine <punct> and opened the compartment to put my carry-on in <punct> 
 i sat down and tried to make myself comfortable <punct> 
 in about 0 minutes <punct> we were ready for take-off <punct> 
 the flight attendant made some announcements <punct> and we were set <punct> 
 i was seated by the window <punct> as i always do <punct> 
 i love sitting by the window <punct> 
 the view is <unk> when you <punct> <unk> that high <punct> 
 i decided to open up a fresh set of <unk> and browsed the <unk> player in front of me <punct> and watched <unk> <punct> 
 my <unk> was interrupted when dinner was being served <punct> 
 i love airport food as well <punct> for the most part <punct> 
 it <punct> s not always the best <punct> but most of the time i like it <punct> 
 after eating <punct> i finished the movie and fell asleep <punct> 
 for the rest of the flight <punct> i saw clouds <punct> sunshine <punct> and other planes <punct> and by <unk> <punct> we landed in new york <punct> at the jfk international airport <punct> 
 it was a great flight <punct> 
 my first flight out of the united states was to <unk> <punct> 
 i was excited but very nervous all at the same time <punct> 
 going through security checks and all that comes with it is nerve racking <punct> 
 but once i finished with that part <punct> the next thing was understand the time change and how that affects my flights and <unk> was a real hassle <punct> 
 once we got on the plane it was absolutely wonderful <punct> 
 the flight attendants took great care of us never stopping to rest for the entire 0 hours flight <punct> 
 they brought food <punct> warm face towels <punct> drinks and snacks and all this was included in the price of the ticket <punct> 
 i am very afraid of flying the take off the landing are the worst parts for me <punct> 
 true to my <unk> i was in near tears and <unk> the seats but once the flight was off the ground i was happy <punct> 
 the flight came with a tv in the back of the set in front of you and there was so many choices of what to watch <punct> 
 i love <unk> and there were numerous ones <punct> 
 i almost hated when the flight was over <punct> 
 the only part that i found difficult was that <punct> i did not have an end seat and so i <unk> to use the bathroom and did n't do so until i was in <unk> <unk> because i did n't want to bother the person on the end seat <punct> 
 so <punct> next time i decide to travel the only change i would make is to select an end seat that way bathroom use is not an issue <punct> 
 taking the train into the city is so much fun <punct> 
 we go into the train station and buy tickets for the train we want to take <punct> 
 when the train arrives at the station it is very loud <punct> 
 we wait for it to stop and then follow the other passengers on board <punct> 
 we find our seats <punct> hopefully near a window <punct> and sit down <punct> 
 when the conductor comes around <punct> we give him our tickets and he punches a hole in each of them <punct> 
 the train begins to move and it makes a <unk> sound as it travels towards the next stop <punct> 
 the buildings and trees we pass look blurry because we are going so fast <punct> 
 we pass railroad <unk> with cars lined up waiting for us to pass <punct> 
 after 0 stops <punct> at different train stations <punct> we arrive at the big one in the city <punct> 
 we get off the train and take the <unk> up to get out of the station <punct> 
 as i was getting ready for work this morning <punct> i noticed in the mirror that my hair was getting a bit longer than i 'd like <punct> 
 i resolved to go get a haircut after work <punct> 
 while i was at work <punct> i researched salons <punct> 
 i decided on one while i was at lunch <punct> and called to make an appointment for 0 pm <punct> 
 i got there about 0 minutes early <punct> and informed the receptionist that i had an appointment <punct> 
 she welcomed me and asked me to have a seat <punct> 
 i saw and perused a few magazines and hairstyle books while i waited <punct> and actually found a style i liked more than what i had already had in mind <punct> 
 once the stylist was done with her previous client <punct> she came to greet me <punct> 
 she asked what i wanted and i presented the picture i found <punct> 
 she said that was no problem <punct> and took me back to the styling chair <punct> 
 she washed and conditioned my hair and put a cape on me <punct> 
 she confirmed with me again what i wanted <punct> and set off to cutting <punct> 
 i sat as tiny bits of hair fell all around me <punct> 
 once she was done <punct> she blow dried and styled my hair <punct> 
 it looked just like the picture <punct> 
 that 's how i got a hair cut <punct> 
 one of my favorite weekly activities is going grocery shopping <punct> 
 yesterday afternoon i took a casual <unk> to my local whole foods and could not resist their <unk> and rather delicious items <punct> 
 my favorite place is the bakery <punct> 
 from the warm <punct> freshly baked chocolate chip cookies <punct> to the <unk> berries and cream cakes <punct> there is not a product that does not <unk> <punct> 
 another section i perused was the prepared food section <punct> 
 from pizza <punct> <unk> <punct> a salad bar <punct> and fried chicken <punct> there was plenty to choose from <punct> 
 my eyes wandered to the burrito bar <punct> as i glanced at the grilled chicken <punct> steak and <unk> vegetables <punct> 
 i ordered a grilled steak burrito stuffed with cheese <punct> hot sauce <punct> <unk> <punct> and <unk> <punct> 
 after i paid the kind <unk> who created it <punct> i took one large <unk> bite and dug in <punct> 
 it was one of the most delicious <unk> i had ever tasted <punct> 
 i made sure to definitely come back next time <punct> 
 with a <unk> i realized why i was so tired <punct> 
 i had flown home yesterday <punct> 
 and it was a very long flight <punct> 
 i had purchased my ticket online <punct> so i only had to check-in when i arrived at the airport <punct> 
 the took my bag at that time <punct> and i walked over to the security gate <punct> 
 i was really happy i had remembered to wear slip on <punct> <unk> shoes <punct> and easy fit clothing <punct> 
 i placed my purse and shoes in the bucket to go through the scanner <punct> and stepped through a scanner of my own <punct> 
 sometimes that is all it takes <punct> but i was tapped on the shoulder <punct> and pulled aside for a random search <punct> 
 this didnt <unk> me though <punct> it happens <punct> although with more <unk> than i would like <punct> 
 a few moments of pat down <punct> and i was putting my shoes back on <punct> 
 taking my purse i headed for the gate listed on my boarding pass <punct> 
 near the gate was a small shop <punct> 
 i decided to buy a bottle of water <punct> and a magazine to read on the plane <punct> 
 i heard an announcement that my plane was beginning to board <punct> so i paid quickly <punct> and <unk> the line at the gate <punct> 
 they checked my boarding pass as i reached the head of the line <punct> and now i was headed down a small hallway to the plane <punct> 
 i could hear the <unk> of engines as i went through the <unk> door <punct> 
 the airline personnel smiled and greeted me <punct> checked my boarding pass <punct> and gave me a general idea of where to find my seat <punct> 
 it <unk> long before they closed the door <punct> and they were giving safety instructions <punct> 
 i listened closely <punct> reading along on the safety card <punct> and smiled remembering my first airline flight <punct> 
 i had been 0 <punct> and could not read yet <punct> 
 i leaned my head back <punct> as the plane taxi 'd <punct> then sped down the runway for takeoff <punct> 
 when i went grocery shopping i started by looking in my refrigerator and figuring out what i needed to get <punct> 
 i made a shopping list based on this <punct> 
 then i decided which store was the best to go to to buy these items <punct> 
 i decided that publix was the best and closest store for me <punct> 
 i walked to the store with my empty backpack <punct> and when i got in the first thing i did was check the <unk> section and sales <punct> 
 after that i walked the aisle <punct> making sure to pick up everything that i needed <punct> 
 i <unk> using a shopping cart to be sure that i would not buy more than i could carry <punct> 
 after picking up all the items i went to the checkout where i paid for my purchases in cash <punct> 
 after that i put the items in my backpack and walked out of the store and back to my house <punct> 
 yesterday <punct> i went to get a hair cut <punct> 
 i made an appointment with my hairstylist a week prior <punct> 
 i was tired of my long hair so i decided it was time for a new hair look <punct> 
 even though <punct> i wanted a new hair style <punct> i was still very nervous <punct> 
 cutting hair is a very big change <punct> 
 before she cut my hair <punct> she washed my hair <punct> 
 after she washed it <punct> she did n't do a big chop <punct> 
 she cut little by little so i wo n't be in <unk> <unk> <punct> 
 every time she cut it <punct> i took a deep breath and <unk> it <punct> 
 after all <punct> hair does grow back eventually <punct> 
 eventually she managed to cut it at the specific length i wanted it <punct> 
 afterwards <punct> she layered it and styled it properly <punct> 
 at this point <punct> she did n't let me see the final result until she was finished <punct> 
 when she was done <punct> she turned me over to the mirror and i was shocked <punct> 
 it was beautiful <punct> 
 i loved my new hair cut <punct> 
 as i was looking in my cabinets and fridge for something to fix for my families supper i realized that a trip to get groceries was very much needed as i was low on food supplies <punct> 
 i grabbed a pen and <unk> and made me a list of all that was needed <punct> 
 i then got dressed and ready <punct> 
 i inspected my handgun to make sure it was cocked <punct> locked and loaded and placed it securely on my right hip <punct> 
 i then made sure i had a extra magazine of <unk> in my left hand <unk> pocket <punct> 
 all that being good i got in the car and off to the store i went <punct> 
 i always start by getting the dry and canned goods first so that my <unk> will stay fresh until i get them home <punct> 
 so many canned items <punct> dry items <punct> then meats and ice cream and frozen goods later i went home and put everything away <punct> 
 yes going on a train <punct> this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago <punct> 
 we purchased tickets to travel from boston to new york city <punct> 
 as we entered the platform of the train is was <unk> <unk> and looked so solidly strong <punct> 
 we walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there <punct> 
 shortly the train <unk> <unk> making me jump of my seat <unk> <punct> 
 anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway <punct> 
 the conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets <punct> 
 love scenery so i had the window seat watching everything along the way <punct> 
 first i saw large suburban areas but as we got into <unk> many farms were being spotted <punct> 
 it was n't very <unk> but sure was a country atmosphere <punct> 
 soon we approached <unk> and the train came to slow stop <punct> we had arrived at our destination <punct> 
 the ride overall was rather smooth and it did n't seem to take all that long <punct> 
 my friend and i set aside a date that we could meet each other <punct> 
 she lives in another area so i had to buy a train ticket <punct> 
 since we planned the trip early <punct> i was able to save a little bit of money <punct> 
 the trip would n't be for another two weeks <punct> 
 i bought the tickets online <punct> 
 once the day finally came <punct> i took a cab to the train station <punct> 
 it was n't very far <punct> 
 once <punct> inside the station <punct> i checked the displays for any signs of my train being late <punct> 
 today <punct> there were n't any <punct> 
 about fifteen minutes later <punct> my train showed up and i got on board <punct> 
 it was crowded but not as much as one of the local trains <punct> 
 i made sure to listen for any announcements about what stops we were arriving at so i 'd know when i was close to my destination <punct> 
 finally <punct> the train arrived at my destination and i met my friend just outside the station <punct> 
 i once had a flat tire on my bicycle <punct> 
 it was quite a surprise when it happened <punct> 
 i had been having a good time riding my bike along a trail and the air went right out of it <punct> 
 i proceeded to flip my bicycle over so it was standing on the handlebars and seat to inspect the damage <punct> 
 once i had that accomplished i had to remove the wheel from the bike <punct> 
 this took a little bit and i needed some tools to finish this task <punct> 
 my bike has a tube in each tire to keep it inflated <punct> 
 something had gone through the outer rubber and punctured that inner tube <punct> 
 i had to remove the outer rubber and find the spot on the inner tube where the hole was <punct> 
 luckily i had a patch kit with me and was able to patch the tube once i found the hole <punct> 
 after waiting for the patch adhesive to set i put the wheel back together <punct> 
 once the wheel was back on my bike i was off riding again <punct> 
 today i rode the public bus to work as i usually do <punct> 
 because i ride several busses daily <punct> i had previously purchased a bus pass that allows unlimited use for the month <punct> 
 by having this pass i did n't need to worry about having proper change or tokens for the bus <punct> 
 i checked the schedule for my bus by using <punct> <punct> google maps <punct> <punct> and determined that my regular bus was on schedule <punct> 
 i walked to the bus stop and saw that my bus was several blocks away <punct> 
 when the bus arrived i boarded it after several other passengers <punct> and then slid my pass through the card reader <punct> 
 there were several seats available and i selected the first one i came to <punct> 
 the bus continued on schedule along the route with passengers departing and boarding <punct> 
 when i arrived at work i gathered all of my personal belongings and disembarked <punct> 
 last weekend i took a bike ride around my neighborhood <punct> 
 when i got back home <punct> i noticed that my front tire looked low <punct> 
 i looked at the tire and realized there was a nail stuck in it <punct> 
 i took the nail out <punct> 
 then removed the tire from the bike <punct> 
 inside the tire was a bike tube <punct> 
 the air goes in the bike tube <punct> but it was leaking because of the hole the nail put in it <punct> 
 i found my patch kit <punct> and glued a bike tube patch over the hole <punct> 
 then i got my air pump <punct> 
 i pumped and pumped until the tube was inflated <punct> 
 afterwards <punct> i put the bike tube in water to see if there were any air bubbles <punct> 
 air bubbles in the water mean there 's still a leak <punct> 
 luckily for me <punct> it was no longer leaking air <punct> 
 i put the tire back over the top of the bike tube and put the tire back on my bicycle <punct> 
 i looked at it carefully <punct> then hopped on for another ride around the neighborhood <punct> this time <unk> any nails <punct> 
 after boarding my plane and placing the luggage in the luggage compartment overhead <punct> i took my seat in my coach section of the airplane <punct> 
 i luckily had the window seat <punct> meaning i had slightly more room than the two strangers next to me on my right <punct> 
 i was able to fold back my seat a little bit to allow for myself to rest my head and back from a rather long drive <punct> 
 i pulled out my book and started reading as the plane took off <punct> 
 about ten minutes into the flight <punct> i decided taking a little nap would be appropriate and helpful during the <unk> flight <punct> 
 i fell asleep for about an hour and continued to read my book <punct> 
 after my eyes got tired of reading <punct> i pulled on the headphones and watching the movie being <unk> in front of all the passengers <punct> 
 the movie ended moments before we started landing <punct> where i would then grab my belongings and head off the plane <punct> 
 i was a little nervous about my plane trip <punct> but my friend was coming with me <punct> and that made me feel a little better <punct> 
 we went to the airport <punct> and gave our bags to an attendant to be checked onto the plane <punct> 
 we went through the security station to make sure everything was safe <punct> then we were ready to go to our terminal <punct> 
 we were there a little early <punct> so we grabbed a bite to eat at the restaurant while we waited <punct> 
 when the plane arrived <punct> we gave the attendant our tickets and got on the plane <punct> 
 once we were all seated <punct> the flight attendant went over some safety rules with us before we took off <punct> 
 i watched out the window as we got higher and higher <punct> 
 it was a little scary <punct> but kind of fun <punct> too <punct> 
 the flight attendant came by and gave us all a little snack during the flight <punct> 
 by the time we landed <punct> i was n't scared anymore <punct> 
 we went to get our bags from the big conveyer belt and were soon on our way from the airport <punct> 
 i was on spring break from school and decided to come home for the week <punct> 
 i did n't have a car so i had to the train <punct> 
 i packed a small bag and took a cab to the train station <punct> 
 i went up to the window and bought a ticket to my hometown <punct> 
 i decided to buy a few snacks and magazines that local <unk> were <unk> while i waited for the train <punct> 
 it came time to board the train and i grabbed my things <punct> 
 i got on the train and sat down by the window seat so that i can enjoy the view <punct> 
 the train announced it 's next destination and started to take off <punct> 
 the conductor came down the aisles and was checking everyone 's ticket <punct> 
 i had my ticket ready and handed him my ticket when he got to me <punct> 
 i got comfortable and started to read a magazine while waiting to arrive at my destination <punct> 
 awhile later the train had arrived at my hometown <punct> 
 i got off the train and met my parents outside the train station who came to pick me up <punct> 
 it had been close to a year since my last trim <punct> 
 i usually make sure i 'm clean if i plan to go to a hairdresser <punct> 
 i jumped in the shower and quickly lathered up <punct> 
 my hair was pretty clean to begin with <punct> but i wanted to make sure i was clean for sure <punct> 
 the haircut place takes <unk> appointments <punct> and i waited barely 0 minutes to be seated in a chair <punct> 
 the attendant was especially nice <punct> and asked how i was <punct> and how i wanted my hair to be done <punct> 
 in the summer i usually keep it quite short <punct> so i asked for most of it to be trimmed off <punct> 
 i asked the hairdresser to go forward with what they thought was best <punct> 
 i usually ask this because they are trained to <unk> what <unk> would work best for certain people <punct> 
 overall <punct> it took 0 minutes for the haircut to finish <punct> 
 after a quick dusting off <punct> i was on my way home with a fresh look <punct> 
 i wanted to go to atlanta to visit my daughter <punct> <unk> and granddaughter <punct> 
 i went on-line and searched for the cheapest flights for the weekend on which i wanted to go <punct> 
 i saw that <unk> airlines had a really reasonable rate so i purchased a ticket for friday <punct> march 0 through sunday <punct> march 0 <punct> 
 several hours before my flight was due <punct> i drove to <unk> airport and parked in the <unk> lot <punct> 
 i went into the airport and passed through the security checkpoint <punct> showing the tsa agent my electronic <unk> pass and my driver 's license <punct> 
 once through security i waited at the gate until the plane had landed for my flight <punct> 
 once boarding started <punct> i got in line with my boarding pass and entered the plane <punct> 
 i found my seat <punct> the aisle seat in row 0 <punct> and sat down <punct> 
 after the safety instructions had been given <punct> the flight taxied to the end of the runway and then took off <punct> 
 in just a few short hours we had safely touched down at the atlanta airport where my daughter was waiting for me <punct> 
 last night we decided to head into new york city <punct> 
 driving in was not a good option <punct> who wants to deal with that kind of traffic <punct> 
 so we decide a better idea was to take the train in <punct> 
 we parked our car at the train station in <unk> and <unk> for weekend parking <punct> 
 i grabbed a small bag and we went to the ticket window to purchase our tickets <punct> 
 after that we just had to wait for our train to arrive and begin boarding <punct> 
 once it was at the station we were so excited <punct> we ran out to the platform and boarded one of the cars <punct> 
 we found seats quickly <punct> unlike an airplane you just sit where you want <punct> 
 and then off we went <punct> 
 the train seemed to stop a lot <punct> there were so many more stations than i realized were out there <punct> 
 eventually though <punct> we heard those magic words <punct> 
 penn station <punct> 
 we had arrived in new york city <punct> 
 when i decide to bake a cake <punct> i go all out <punct> 
 nothing <unk> a homemade cake <punct> the boxed kind are junk <punct> 
 it was no different this past weekend when i got the <unk> for a chocolate cake <punct> 
 i first went out a bought the ingredients <punct> 
 they were as <unk> <punct> 0 cups butter <punct> 0 eggs <punct> 0 cups sugar <punct> 0 cups flour <punct> 0 cup unsweetened cocoa powder <punct> 0 teaspoon baking soda <punct> 0 teaspoon baking powder <punct> 0 teaspoon vanilla <punct> and 0 0 cup milk <punct> 
 i pre-heated my oven to 0 degrees <punct> 
 i then greased and floured three 0 <punct> <punct> <unk> 0 0 <punct> <punct> round cake pans <punct> 
 i mixed together the flour <punct> cocoa powder <punct> baking powder and baking soda <punct> 
 in a different large bowl <punct> i beat butter <punct> eggs and vanilla like it stole something <punct> 
 gradually i added the sugary goodness of sugar to the mix <punct> 
 beating this on medium to the sound of <unk> boy <punct> i did this until it was well mixed <punct> 
 i then alternately combined in the flour mixture and milk to batter while beating <punct> 
 continuing to beat until batter was smooth <punct> i then poured equal amounts of batter into the greased and floured round cake pans <punct> 
 i tossed this delicious mixture into the oven to bake for 0 minutes <punct> 
 finally i was able to remove the cakes <punct> which i then placed on a wire cooling rack <punct> 
 another 0 minutes passed <punct> after which i proceeded to destroy all the cakes <punct> eating every last bite until i could n't eat any more <punct> <punct> 
 <punct> <punct> fun <punct> this has been my favorite so far <punct>
