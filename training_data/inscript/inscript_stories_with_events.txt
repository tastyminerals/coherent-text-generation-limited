 I was sitting_(UnrelEv) on my couch when I decided_(UnrelEv) that I had n't taken_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) in a while so I stood_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) and walked_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) to the bathroom where I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the faucet in the sink and began_(UnrelEv) filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the bath with hot water .
 While the tub was filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) with hot water I put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some bubble bath into the stream of hot water coming_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) out_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) of the faucet so that the tubbed filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) with not only hot water , but bubbles .
 Once the tub was_(UnrelEv) almost to the top I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) off_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the water so that none of the water would overflow_(RelNScrEv) onto the bathroom floor .
 I got undressed_(ScrEv_undress) and entered_(ScrEv_sink_water) the tub , making_(ScrEv_check_temp) sure_(ScrEv_check_temp) that it 's_(UnrelEv) not very hot .
 I relax_(ScrEv_relax) in the tub until I am_(UnrelEv) happy with my bath and then I get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) and dry_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) with a towel and then get_(UnrelEv) dressed_(ScrEv_get_dressed) and laid_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) in my bed and took_(RelNScrEv) a nap , feeling_(UnrelEv) very relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) , content , and happy .

 Yesterday , I got_(UnrelEv) ready to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) because I had_(UnrelEv) a long stressful day .
 I started_(UnrelEv) running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the water and made_(ScrEv_check_temp) sure_(ScrEv_check_temp) it was_(UnrelEv) just the right temperature .
 I did n't want_(UnrelEv) the tub too hot or too cold .
 Just perfect was_(UnrelEv) what I needed_(UnrelEv) .
 After getting_(UnrelEv) the bath tub to the required_(UnrelEv) temperature .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some bubbles in it to make_(UnrelEv) it extra fun !
 I hopped_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the bath tub and soaked_(RelNScrEv) in it for quite some time while reading_(RelNScrEv) a nice book .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a great relief to a very long day .
 I love_(UnrelEv) taking_(Evoking) baths_(Evoking) at the end of the day to unwind_(UnrelEv) .
 After a twenty minutes , or so , it was_(UnrelEv) time to hop_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out and get_(ScrEv_dry) dried_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) .

 Before I go_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) into the bathroom I always grab_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel from the linen closet where we keep_(RelNScrEv) our towels , soap and shampoo .
 I like to put_(RelNScrEv) a radio on while I take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) so I can relax_(ScrEv_relax) and enjoy_(ScrEv_relax) myself .
 I plug_(ScrEv_close_drain) the tub with a water stopper and turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on the water so it 's_(UnrelEv) nice and warm but not too hot .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) in some bubbles so it makes_(UnrelEv) it nice and bubbly and smelling_(RelNScrEv) good .
 When the tub is all filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) I stop_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the water and slowly get_(ScrEv_sink_water) inside .
 I sit_(ScrEv_relax) down for about ten minutes relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) with my eyes closed_(UnrelEv) and just thinking_(UnrelEv) about the day .
 After about ten minutes I take_(ScrEv_open_drain) the stopper out so the tub can drain_(ScrEv_other) and turn_(ScrEv_other) the shower head on .
 I like_(UnrelEv) to wash_(ScrEv_wash) myself off after a bath because there are_(UnrelEv) a lot of bubbles all over me .

 After a long workout at the gym , I got_(UnrelEv) home and immediately wanted_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) ._(Evoking)
 First , I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water in my tub on as hot as it could go_(UnrelEv) so the water could warm_(RelNScrEv) up .
 Then , after the water warmed_(RelNScrEv) up , I placed_(RelNScrEv) two fingers in the stream of water to see_(UnrelEv) how hot it was_(UnrelEv) .
 After that , I adjusted_(ScrEv_check_temp) the water to a temperature I could enjoy_(RelNScrEv) during my bath .
 Now that the water was_(UnrelEv) at the correct temperature , I put_(ScrEv_close_drain) the stop drain in place .
 This allows the water to stay_(RelNScrEv) in the tub .
 After the stop drain was_(UnrelEv) in place , I put_(UnrelEv) soap in the water .
 Now it was_(UnrelEv) time to let_(UnrelEv) the water fill_(RelNScrEv) the tub .
 When the tub was_(UnrelEv) full of water , it was_(UnrelEv) time for me to get_(ScrEv_sink_water) in .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) I wanted_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) nice_(Evoking) ,_(Evoking) luxurious_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 First , I went_(RelNScrEv) through_(RelNScrEv) my bathroom cabinets and found_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) some really nice smelling_(RelNScrEv) bath salts .
 I found_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) my biggest , fluffiest towel and set_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) it next to the bathtub .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water and let_(UnrelEv) it run_(RelNScrEv) until it was_(UnrelEv) hot .
 Once the water ran_(RelNScrEv) hot , I shut_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain , so the water would fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the top .
 Then I poured_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) my nice smelling_(RelNScrEv) bath salts into the tub .
 They turned_(RelNScrEv) the water a lovely pink color .
 I watched_(UnrelEv) the water fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub and the bathroom became_(RelNScrEv) steamy .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a washcloth from the cabinet and got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the water .
 It was_(UnrelEv) hot and smelled_(RelNScrEv) wonderful .
 I let_(UnrelEv) myself relax_(ScrEv_relax) and enjoy_(ScrEv_relax) the experience .

 Everyone knows_(UnrelEv) that cleanliness is close to Godliness .
 It was_(UnrelEv) this mind frame that led_(UnrelEv) me to take_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) third_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) of_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) day_(Evoking) a few minutes ago .
 I had decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) outside and shoot_(UnrelEv) my assault rifle and do_(UnrelEv) some pistol drills since it was_(UnrelEv) such a warm and beautiful day outside .
 The sweat started_(UnrelEv) coming_(UnrelEv) from my body as I trained_(UnrelEv) hard and the spent_(UnrelEv) gunpowder began_(UnrelEv) to cling_(UnrelEv) to my sweat moistened_(UnrelEv) skin .
 Soon I was_(UnrelEv) rather stinky and covered_(UnrelEv) in gun powder .
 Time to go_(UnrelEv) inside , clean_(UnrelEv) my weapons and prepare_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a good hot bath .
 Not just any bath but one that is_(UnrelEv) piping hot and with bubbles in it .
 I removed_(ScrEv_undress) my clothing and carefully put_(ScrEv_sink_water) one foot in the hot water .
 Ouch !
 Very hot just the way I like_(UnrelEv) it .
 I eased_(ScrEv_sink_water) my body into the tub , lit_(UnrelEv) a cigarette and soaked_(UnrelEv) away the fatigue of my previous workout .

 I returned_(UnrelEv) to my home one evening after a long day of hiking_(UnrelEv) and exploring_(UnrelEv) the outdoors .
 I had_(UnrelEv) dirt caked_(UnrelEv) on my legs and grass stains on my knees , so I needed to clean_(Evoking) myself_(Evoking) up_(Evoking) before getting_(UnrelEv) into bed .
 I got_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel and washcloth from my linen closet and brought_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) them into my bathroom .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on both the hot and cold knobs in the bathtub and let_(UnrelEv) the water run_(RelNScrEv) for a few moments before I put_(UnrelEv) my hand under it to test_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature .
 I turned_(RelNScrEv) each knob until the water felt_(UnrelEv) warm and comfortable .
 Then I plugged_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain and undressed_(ScrEv_undress) , putting_(ScrEv_other) my dirty clothes in the hamper .
 Once the bathtub was_(UnrelEv) about halfway full , I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) off the water and carefully sat_(ScrEv_sink_water) down in the tub .
 I took_(UnrelEv) some soap from the dish and rubbed_(ScrEv_apply_soap) it on the washcloth , then scrubbed_(ScrEv_wash) my dirty legs until the mud and grass disappeared_(UnrelEv) .
 I let_(UnrelEv) the water rinse_(ScrEv_wash) away the soap .
 Once I felt_(UnrelEv) clean , I stepped_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out of the tub and wrapped_(ScrEv_other) a towel around myself to dry_(ScrEv_dry) off .
 Then I pulled_(ScrEv_open_drain) the plug out of the drain and let_(UnrelEv) the water disappear_(UnrelEv) down the pipes .
 As the tub was draining_(RelNScrEv) , I dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself completely with the towel and put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) on pajamas .
 I hung_(ScrEv_other) up my wet towel and washcloth and was_(UnrelEv) ready to go_(UnrelEv) to bed , all clean from the bath .

 While casually browsing_(UnrelEv) through my friends pictures online I discovered_(UnrelEv) a new revelation .
 They are called_(UnrelEv) Lush bath_(Evoking) bombs_(Evoking) and the are_(UnrelEv) colorful scented fizz balls .
 I quickly ordered_(RelNScrEv) a few online from their website and when they came_(UnrelEv) I was overcome_(UnrelEv) with excitement .
 I brought_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one .
 I put_(ScrEv_close_drain) the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) my bathwater until the tub was_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) halfway full .
 Then I dropped_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) the bath bomb in the water and was anointed_(UnrelEv) by the wonderful smell of lavender .
 The water in the tub fizzled_(RelNScrEv) with pretty blue glitter .
 I got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in an soaked_(ScrEv_relax) for more than an hour and got_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out feeling_(RelNScrEv) like a million bucks .
 I seemed_(UnrelEv) to be a thousand times cleaner than I was_(UnrelEv) before I got_(UnrelEv) it .
 I even smelled_(RelNScrEv) great the whole entire day .

 After a long day at work and then the gym , I knew_(UnrelEv) that a shower would not suffice_(UnrelEv) .
 I needed_(UnrelEv) a bath - a long , refreshing , bubbly bath with the radio blasting_(UnrelEv) my favorite songs .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel , a luffa , and my radio and headed_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) to the bathroom .
 I sighed_(UnrelEv) in relief as I eyed_(UnrelEv) the bathtub .
 I whistled_(UnrelEv) a tune as I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot water on and poured_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some of the bubble bath mix that I had_(UnrelEv) .
 The bubbles quickly covered_(UnrelEv) the water as I happily took_(ScrEv_undress) off_(ScrEv_undress) my clothes and dove_(ScrEv_sink_water) right in !
 I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) my rubber ducky that was sitting_(UnrelEv) on the edge of the tub and moved_(UnrelEv) it into the water with me .
 As I listened_(RelNScrEv) to the radio , I scrubbed_(ScrEv_wash) and washed_(ScrEv_wash) myself thoroughly , taking_(UnrelEv) my time .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the water off and continued_(UnrelEv) bathing_(Unclear) until my skin began_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) all pruney .
 I hopped_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out of the tub and toweled_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) so that I was_(UnrelEv) as clean and dry as a whistle .
 I turned_(UnrelEv) my radio off and walked_(ScrEv_leave) out of the bathroom with a big smile on my face .

 I set_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) down a few candles , not too many , and started_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water .
 After I let_(UnrelEv) the water warm_(RelNScrEv) up a bit , I stopped_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the drain , and the tub slowly filled_(RelNScrEv) with warm water .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) in some mineral salts to help_(UnrelEv) make_(UnrelEv) the experience more pleasing_(UnrelEv) .
 Once the tub was_(UnrelEv) full , I took_(ScrEv_undress) off all my clothes and got_(ScrEv_sink_water) inside .
 For the most part , all I did_(UnrelEv) was rest_(ScrEv_relax) there and relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a great way to slow_(UnrelEv) things down on a fast-paced_(UnrelEv) day .
 For several minutes , I just enjoyed_(ScrEv_relax) the warm water but I made_(UnrelEv) sure to wash_(ScrEv_wash) up with soap and shampoo before the water got_(RelNScrEv) too cold .

 It 's been_(UnrelEv) a while since I have taken_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) , I usually shower_(RelNScrEv) .
 When I do bathe_(Evoking) , I tend_(UnrelEv) to make_(UnrelEv) a big deal of it , with bubble bath or bath oil , and book to read_(ScrEv_relax) in the tub , and very hot water .
 Some bubble bath comes_(UnrelEv) in carnation fragrance , and sometimes I have_(UnrelEv) a packet in one of the bathroom drawers .
 If I have_(UnrelEv) one , I put_(ScrEv_close_drain) in_(ScrEv_close_drain) the bathtub plug and open_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) the packet and empty_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) it under the bath tap .
 I turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) only the hot water , because at my house it starts_(UnrelEv) out cold and only gradually heats_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) .
 I do test_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature on my arm and adjust_(ScrEv_check_temp) it as the tub fills_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) .
 I get_(ScrEv_take_clean_clothes) fresh clothes and put_(ScrEv_take_clean_clothes) them on the counter .
 I also get_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) an old paperback book , and put_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) it by the tub .
 Finally I undress_(ScrEv_undress) , and usually put_(RelNScrEv) the clothes I 'm taking_(ScrEv_undress) off_(ScrEv_undress) in the hamper .
 I do_(UnrelEv) all this rather slowly , because the tub fills_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) so slowly .
 I climb_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) carefully , and again slowly , because the water is_(UnrelEv) so hot .
 I slither_(ScrEv_sink_water) down_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the tub , so I am buried_(RelNScrEv) in suds .
 Then I pick_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) my book and start_(UnrelEv) to read_(ScrEv_relax) .
 Chances are_(UnrelEv) , unless I 'm_(UnrelEv) really grubby I wont scrub_(ScrEv_wash) until the bubbles start_(UnrelEv) to diminish_(UnrelEv) , if then .
 I just let_(UnrelEv) the heat soak_(ScrEv_relax) into me .
 Finally I wash_(ScrEv_wash) , emphasizing_(UnrelEv) body folds , using_(RelNScrEv) just bar soap , no washcloth .
 I drain_(ScrEv_open_drain) the bath tub and stand_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) up_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) , and sometimes I 'll shower_(RelNScrEv) quickly to refresh_(UnrelEv) myself , because I 'm so relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) I could fall_(UnrelEv) asleep where I stand_(UnrelEv) .
 I climb_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) onto the mat and get_(UnrelEv) dressed_(ScrEv_get_dressed) , usually ready for bed .

 A couple of nights ago I felt_(UnrelEv) really sick , and one of the things that usually helps_(UnrelEv) me feel better is_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hot_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 So I went_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) into my bathroom and prepared_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) the bath tub .
 First I plugged_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain so the water would n't escape_(RelNScrEv) .
 Then I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot water and let_(UnrelEv) it fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) .
 The process took_(UnrelEv) about five minutes .
 I then tested_(ScrEv_check_temp) the water to see_(UnrelEv) how hot it was_(UnrelEv) , because I did n't want_(UnrelEv) to jump_(ScrEv_sink_water) right in and burn_(RelNScrEv) myself .
 I decided_(ScrEv_check_temp) it was_(UnrelEv) a little too hot , so I let_(UnrelEv) it cool for a couple of minutes .
 Once the water was_(ScrEv_check_temp) a comfortable temperature I stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) and laid_(ScrEv_sink_water) down_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the water .
 I let_(UnrelEv) the warm water sooth_(ScrEv_relax) my aches and pains and I began_(UnrelEv) to feel_(ScrEv_relax) better .
 I had n't taken_(UnrelEv) a shower that day , so I decided_(UnrelEv) I should also clean_(ScrEv_wash) myself while I was_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 Once that was_(UnrelEv) over I unplugged_(ScrEv_open_drain) the drain and dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself off .

 It first begins_(UnrelEv) with turning_(ScrEv_other) on the heater in the bathroom for 10 minutes so that when I am waiting_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) for the water to be_(UnrelEv) warm I do not freeze_(UnrelEv) .
 My parents and siblings think_(UnrelEv) that this is_(UnrelEv) weird but I do not care_(UnrelEv) because it is_(UnrelEv) my way of doing_(UnrelEv) things .
 I look_(UnrelEv) forward to a warm bath and enjoy_(UnrelEv) getting_(RelNScrEv) clean and soaking_(RelNScrEv) afterwards to relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 Once the bath is_(UnrelEv) full I slowly get_(ScrEv_sink_water) in and feel_(UnrelEv) the warmth wrap_(UnrelEv) around my body .
 After getting_(UnrelEv) comfy I close_(UnrelEv) my eyes and relax_(ScrEv_relax) for 10 or 15 minutes before beginning_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_wash) clean and proceed_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out .
 After cleaning_(ScrEv_wash) I do not like_(UnrelEv) to relax_(ScrEv_relax) any longer because you are basically sitting_(UnrelEv) in your dirt , grime , and filth .
 This is_(UnrelEv) quite disgusting_(UnrelEv) to think_(UnrelEv) about and I would not ever recommend_(UnrelEv) anyone to rest_(ScrEv_relax) or relax_(ScrEv_relax) in the filth .
 No matter how warm or cozy the water still seems_(UnrelEv) .

 After a very tough workout with some friend 's at the gym , I was_(UnrelEv) very sore and wanted to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) to help_(UnrelEv) my soreness and get_(UnrelEv) clean .
 I remembered_(UnrelEv) that mom bought_(UnrelEv) me something to put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) inside of the bath that helped_(UnrelEv) soothe_(UnrelEv) sore muscles .
 I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) it from the cabinet and turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water on to very hot .
 After about 3 minutes , the tub was_(UnrelEv) full and I poured_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some of the mixture in it and it became_(UnrelEv) very bubbly and smelled_(UnrelEv) great .
 I slowly placed_(ScrEv_sink_water) myself into the bathtub and lit_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a few candles to help_(UnrelEv) me relax_(ScrEv_relax) , as I had_(UnrelEv) a very long day .
 After about 30 minutes of soaking_(RelNScrEv) in the very warm water , I got_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out of the tub , dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself and then drained_(RelNScrEv) it .
 After it fully drained_(RelNScrEv) , I ran_(RelNScrEv) some more water in order to fully rinse_(RelNScrEv) all of the soap mixture down the drain , leaving_(UnrelEv) a very clean tub .
 After this , I changed_(ScrEv_get_dressed) into comfortable clothes and enjoyed_(UnrelEv) my evening .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a very relaxing bath .

 When I have_(UnrelEv) a long day at work , I like_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) before I go_(UnrelEv) to bed .
 Baths are_(UnrelEv) very relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .
 They make_(UnrelEv) me sleepy and feel nice .
 I start_(UnrelEv) my bath by turning_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the warm water faucet .
 Then I plug_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain so the water will stay_(RelNScrEv) in the tub .
 Sometimes I pour_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some bubble bath into the tub .
 When I do_(UnrelEv) this , I pour_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) a little bit of bubble bath liquid under the running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) water .
 Whenever the tub is_(UnrelEv) about halfway full of water , I get_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the tub and relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 Sometimes I read_(RelNScrEv) a book in the bathtub , and other times I simply sit_(RelNScrEv) there .
 When I am not reading_(RelNScrEv) , I often think_(RelNScrEv) about my day and what I will do_(UnrelEv) tomorrow .
 After about 15 or 20 minutes , I decide_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) of the tub .
 I drain_(ScrEv_open_drain) the water and bubbles , and my bath is_(UnrelEv) over .

 I took_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) for the first time in a long time last week .
 I wanted_(UnrelEv) to be able to relax_(ScrEv_relax) and get_(RelNScrEv) clean without all the work of standing_(UnrelEv) up to shower_(UnrelEv) !
 First , I made_(UnrelEv) sure the bathtub was cleaned_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 I then ran_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot water first and filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up most of the bathtub .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the hot water off and then turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the cold on , that way the temperature of the water was_(UnrelEv) not too hot and not too cold , but just right .
 I got_(UnrelEv) a book that I had been wanting_(UnrelEv) to read_(UnrelEv) and climbed_(ScrEv_sink_water) in .
 After reading_(UnrelEv) for awhile , I decided_(UnrelEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) time to wash_(ScrEv_wash) off since the water was starting_(UnrelEv) to cool_(RelNScrEv) down .
 I washed_(ScrEv_wash) off my face and body , and then used_(UnrelEv) shampoo and conditioner in my hair .
 When I was_(UnrelEv) all done , I drained_(ScrEv_open_drain) the water from the tub and used_(UnrelEv) the shower to rinse_(ScrEv_wash) off .
 I dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself off with a big towel and put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) on my pajamas so I would be_(UnrelEv) comfortable .
----------
InScript/corpus/bath/bath_004.xml

 It was_(UnrelEv) a hard day , so I looked_(UnrelEv) forward to making_(UnrelEv) myself the perfect bath .
 I get_(UnrelEv) home from work and head_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) straight for the bathtub .
 I run_(RelNScrEv) the water until it 's_(UnrelEv) the perfect temperature and plug_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain to allow_(UnrelEv) the water to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub .
 I take_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some bath salts and oils to drizzle_(UnrelEv) underneath the stream of water to allow_(UnrelEv) it to dissolve_(UnrelEv) and it fills_(UnrelEv) the room with gentle fragrance .
 As the tub continues_(UnrelEv) to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) with water , I grab_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) some candles and carefully place_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) them around the tub .
 After lighting_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) the candles and setting_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) up_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel and robe for getting_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) , I put_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) on_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) some quiet music to drown_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) the sound of my husband 's hockey game .
 I grab_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a small towel to use_(UnrelEv) as a pillow for my neck and finally get_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the bath .
 I feel_(UnrelEv) like I 'm melting_(UnrelEv) as I shut_(UnrelEv) my eyes and allow_(UnrelEv) myself to relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 I do n't realize_(UnrelEv) how long I 'm_(UnrelEv) in there until I open_(UnrelEv) my eyes and see_(UnrelEv) my husband standing_(UnrelEv) over me .
 The water has lost_(RelNScrEv) all its warmth .
 He had put_(UnrelEv) the towel in the dryer and it was_(UnrelEv) now warm , fluffy , and welcoming .
 I step_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) of the day as my troubles swirl_(UnrelEv) down the drain .

 It was_(UnrelEv) Saturday night so it was_(UnrelEv) time for me to take_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) weekly_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot water and waited_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) for the water coming_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) of the tap to get_(ScrEv_check_temp) warm .
 When it did_(UnrelEv) , I closed_(ScrEv_close_drain) the stopper and waited_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) for the bath to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) .
 While it was doing_(UnrelEv) so , I took_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) some bath salts from the shelf and added_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) them to the water .
 I could smell_(RelNScrEv) lavender .
 When the bath was_(UnrelEv) full , I lit_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a candle and then took_(ScrEv_undress) off_(ScrEv_undress) my clothes and got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the water .
 I closed_(ScrEv_relax) my eyes and soaked_(ScrEv_relax) for a while , feeling_(UnrelEv) the hot water relax_(ScrEv_relax) my sore muscles .
 After a few minutes I grabbed_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a bar of soap and a washcloth and scrubbed_(ScrEv_wash) my body , taking_(ScrEv_wash) off_(ScrEv_wash) the dirt and dead skin .
 Then I soaked_(ScrEv_relax) some more , almost falling_(RelNScrEv) asleep_(RelNScrEv) .
 Finally , it was_(UnrelEv) time to get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) so I let_(ScrEv_open_drain) out_(ScrEv_open_drain) the water , grabbed_(ScrEv_get_towel) a towel and dried_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) .

 Yesterday was_(UnrelEv) a long and stressful day .
 From start to finish , it felt_(UnrelEv) like nothing could possibly go_(UnrelEv) right .
 On days like those , I really love_(UnrelEv) a nice bubble bath to relax_(ScrEv_relax) and wash_(ScrEv_wash) off_(ScrEv_wash) the stress , so that is_(UnrelEv) what I did_(UnrelEv) .
 I gathered_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) up_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel , body wash , shampoo , conditioner , bubble bath and a few candles and walked_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) into my bathroom to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) nice_(Evoking) ,_(Evoking) long_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I lit_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) the cinnamon-scented candles , turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) warm before I stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) , then I dropped_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) a little bit of the bubble bath in the water to create_(UnrelEv) a gentle lather .
 I sank_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the bubbles and took_(UnrelEv) a deep breath .
 It felt_(UnrelEv) amazing to get_(UnrelEv) to relax_(ScrEv_relax) after such a rough day .
 The candles made_(UnrelEv) the whole bathroom smell_(UnrelEv) great and the water was_(UnrelEv) awesome on my skin .
 Finally , I shampooed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair and washed_(ScrEv_wash) myself , then toweled_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) and put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) on_(ScrEv_get_dressed) my pajamas to get_(UnrelEv) ready_(UnrelEv) for bed .

 After a long week , I decided_(UnrelEv) on a whim to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 It had been_(UnrelEv) years since I last took_(Evoking) one ; I honestly could n't remember_(UnrelEv) the last time .
 As soon as I got_(UnrelEv) home from work , I kicked_(UnrelEv) off my shoes , and walked_(UnrelEv) excitedly up to the master bathroom .
 I plugged_(ScrEv_close_drain) the tub , and started_(UnrelEv) running_(RelNScrEv) the water .
 I adjusted_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature until it was_(UnrelEv) just right : not too hot , not too cold , just warm and comfortable .
 After a few drops of the bath liquid , bubbles filled_(RelNScrEv) the tub as the floral aroma filled_(RelNScrEv) the air .
 I slowly took_(ScrEv_undress) off the last of my garments , finally free from everything .
 I quickly grabbed_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a glass of wine and when I returned_(RelNScrEv) , the tub was_(UnrelEv) full and ready .
 I slipped_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub and soaked_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the bliss .
 I lounged_(ScrEv_relax) for what seemed like hours .
 Before I knew_(UnrelEv) it , the wine was gone_(UnrelEv) and I was starting_(UnrelEv) to prune_(RelNScrEv) .
 My bath was done_(UnrelEv) .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out and dried_(ScrEv_dry) the last of the relaxing_(RelNScrEv) water off of my body as the last of the bath went_(RelNScrEv) down the drain .
 Though my bath was_(UnrelEv) over , I felt the relaxing_(RelNScrEv) affects for hours .

 I take_(UnrelEv) showers in the morning , but I enjoy_(UnrelEv) taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) in the evening .
 I find_(UnrelEv) it relaxes_(ScrEv_relax) me and helps_(UnrelEv) me to sleep_(UnrelEv) better .
 I have_(UnrelEv) a bottle of pink bubble bath that I like_(UnrelEv) to use_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) when I bathe_(Evoking) .
 I begin_(UnrelEv) by making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the water will stay_(UnrelEv) in the tub , by flipping_(ScrEv_close_drain) up_(ScrEv_close_drain) the lever below the faucet .
 It prevents_(UnrelEv) the water from going_(RelNScrEv) down the drain .
 Then I turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot and cold water until it comes_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) of the faucet at a temperature I like_(UnrelEv) , then make_(UnrelEv) the water a little bit hotter because it usually cools_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) as the tub is filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) .
 While the water is running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I add_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some of my bubble bath directly under the stream of water .
 It immediately starts_(UnrelEv) to foam_(RelNScrEv) and bubble_(RelNScrEv) , and fills_(UnrelEv) the bathroom with a wonderful fragrance .
 When the tub is filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) almost to the top , I get_(ScrEv_undress) undressed_(ScrEv_undress) and get_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) .
 The water rises_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) around me as I sink_(ScrEv_sink_water) under the water and I am surrounded_(UnrelEv) by foamy bubbles .
 I lean_(RelNScrEv) my head back against the edge of the tub and relax_(ScrEv_relax) in the warm water .
 It feels_(UnrelEv) wonderful .
 I soak_(RelNScrEv) for a while , then take_(RelNScrEv) a washcloth and dip_(RelNScrEv) it in the water .
 I rub_(ScrEv_apply_soap) the washcloth on a bar of soap and gently scrub_(ScrEv_wash) my body .
 I soak_(RelNScrEv) for a while longer until the water starts_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) uncomfortably cool .
 I flip_(ScrEv_open_drain) the lever and the water begins_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) down the drain .
 I 'm covered_(UnrelEv) with bubbles , so I stand_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) and turn_(RelNScrEv) on_(RelNScrEv) the shower to rinse_(RelNScrEv) them off .
 When I no longer have_(UnrelEv) any soap on me , I get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out of the tub and dry_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) with a fluffy towel .
 A warm bath at the end of a long day is_(UnrelEv) very comforting .

 Once I have the tub filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) halfway I turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) off the water .
 I get_(ScrEv_undress) undressed and put_(ScrEv_other) my clothes in the clothes hamper .
 I step_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub and take_(ScrEv_sink_water) a seat .
 I get_(RelNScrEv) my washcloth and wet_(RelNScrEv) it to wash_(ScrEv_wash) my face first .
 I then dip_(RelNScrEv) my washcloth in the water again and lather_(ScrEv_apply_soap) it up with soap and begin washing_(ScrEv_wash) the rest of my body .

 As I was getting_(UnrelEv) ready for bed last night , I took_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I took_(ScrEv_undress) off_(ScrEv_undress) my clothes , then turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water in the tub .

 I saw_(UnrelEv) there was_(UnrelEv) enough water , so I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) it off and got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the tub .
 I took_(RelNScrEv) the bottle of shampoo and put_(ScrEv_wash) some in my hair .
 As I scrubbed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair , there were_(UnrelEv) lots of suds .
 I rinsed_(RelNScrEv) my hair real well , then took_(RelNScrEv) the bar of soap and started_(UnrelEv) washing_(ScrEv_wash) my body .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_wash) the soap all over me , then rinsed_(RelNScrEv) it off afterwards .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out of the tub and pulled_(ScrEv_open_drain) the plug , watching_(UnrelEv) all the soapy water go_(RelNScrEv) down the drain .
 I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) the towel I had set_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) out_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) earlier , and dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself off .

 I like_(UnrelEv) taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) instead of a shower sometimes .
 I start_(UnrelEv) by closing_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain at the bottom of the tub .
 Some tubs have_(UnrelEv) a stopper and some have_(UnrelEv) a thing you push_(UnrelEv) down to close_(ScrEv_close_drain) it .
 After it 's_(UnrelEv) closed_(ScrEv_close_drain) I like_(UnrelEv) to run_(RelNScrEv) both hot and cold water to make_(UnrelEv) warm water and then I let_(UnrelEv) the tub fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub .
 While the water is running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I squirt_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) in_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) bubbles and make_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) sure_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) I have_(UnrelEv) a clean washcloth and towel .
 After I carefully climb_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub , I make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I wash_(ScrEv_wash) my whole body with the soap and washcloth , even behind my ears and between my toes .
 Then I can either soak_(RelNScrEv) and relax_(ScrEv_relax) in the tub or I can play_(RelNScrEv) with toys .
 Fun toys for the bathtub are_(UnrelEv) boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks .
 Once the water starts_(UnrelEv) to turn_(RelNScrEv) a little cold , it 's_(UnrelEv) time to get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) so I open_(ScrEv_open_drain) the drain again and let_(UnrelEv) the water empty_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 While it 's draining_(RelNScrEv) I carefully stand_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) and reach_(UnrelEv) for my towel to dry_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) .
 I always be_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) the tub is_(UnrelEv) clean when I 'm_(UnrelEv) finished , with toys and the dirty washcloth put_(RelNScrEv) where they belong_(UnrelEv) .

 After a long day , I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I changed_(RelNScrEv) out of my clothes into a plush bathrobe .
 I placed_(ScrEv_close_drain) a plug in the tub drain so the tub could fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water and adjusted_(RelNScrEv) it so it was_(UnrelEv) just the right temperature - hot , but not too hot .
 I sprinkled_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) in_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some lavender scented_(UnrelEv) bath salts to make_(UnrelEv) it extra relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .
 It took_(UnrelEv) about five minutes for the whole tub to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) .
 I did n't fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) it all the way to the top .
 I had to leave_(UnrelEv) some room since I 'd be getting_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) ready , I dipped_(RelNScrEv) my toe in first , testing_(ScrEv_check_temp) out_(ScrEv_check_temp) the water .
 I hung_(ScrEv_undress) my robe on the back of the door , and got_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub .
 I eased_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) slowly since the water was_(UnrelEv) hot .
 I got_(Unclear) nestled_(Unclear) in to the water and washed_(ScrEv_wash) myself with a washcloth and soap .
 Then I leaned_(UnrelEv) my head against the rim of the bathtub .
 I breathed_(UnrelEv) in_(UnrelEv) the aroma of lavender , closed_(UnrelEv) my eyes , and felt_(UnrelEv) my body and mind completely relax_(ScrEv_relax) .

 After I finished_(UnrelEv) , I plugged_(ScrEv_close_drain) the tub and began_(UnrelEv) filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) it with warm water set_(UnrelEv) at about 98 degrees .

 I briefly tested_(ScrEv_check_temp) the water with my elbow and then stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub to lay_(ScrEv_sink_water) down_(ScrEv_sink_water) .
 For about 25 minutes , I lay_(ScrEv_relax) in the tub and relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) by closing_(UnrelEv) my eyes .
 I had also took_(UnrelEv) the time to read_(RelNScrEv) pages of a book I had brought_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) with me .
 Once my body was_(UnrelEv) totally relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) , I took_(RelNScrEv) a quick shower to rinse_(RelNScrEv) myself off and then drained_(RelNScrEv) the tub .
 Next , I dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself off with a towel and put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) my clothes back on .

 I began_(UnrelEv) by drawing_(RelNScrEv) myself a bath .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water on and made_(UnrelEv) sure that the temperature was_(UnrelEv) not too hot and not too cold .

 How you take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) varies_(UnrelEv) a bit with what type of bathing facilities you have_(UnrelEv) .
 I 'm going to describe_(UnrelEv) the typical definition of a bath .
 Go_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) to your tub and take_(UnrelEv) the shower curtain out of the tub if it is_(UnrelEv) inside it .
 You do n't want it to get_(UnrelEv) wet !
 Before you close_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain you should turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water and let_(UnrelEv) it run_(RelNScrEv) for a little bit so you can get_(RelNScrEv) it to the right temperature before you start filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub .
 If you have_(UnrelEv) somewhere to store_(UnrelEv) the water you can place_(UnrelEv) a bucket under the warming_(UnrelEv) water and use_(UnrelEv) it for another purpose .
 Conservation !
 Once the water coming_(UnrelEv) from the tap is_(UnrelEv) at the temperature you like_(UnrelEv) you can place_(ScrEv_close_drain) the stopper in the drain and start_(UnrelEv) filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub .
 Make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) you do n't fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub all the way to the top because the water will displace_(UnrelEv) once you get_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub .
 You can also get_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) as the tub is filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) so you can make_(UnrelEv) a better judgment about when to turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) off_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the water .
 While you are_(UnrelEv) in the tub you should take_(RelNScrEv) a wash cloth and soap or bodywash to give_(ScrEv_wash) yourself a good scrub down .
 If you need to wash_(ScrEv_wash) your hair it is_(UnrelEv) often better to do_(UnrelEv) it after your bath .
 You can put_(ScrEv_wash) the shampoo in your hair and as the tub empties_(RelNScrEv) place_(UnrelEv) your head under the faucet to rinse_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) the soap .

 The Long Awaited_(UnrelEv) Bath I had been_(UnrelEv) outside working_(UnrelEv) in my garden all day .
 It was_(UnrelEv) warm and humid outside so besides being caked_(UnrelEv) in dirt , I also had sweated_(UnrelEv) a lot and did not smell_(UnrelEv) very good .
 I wanted_(UnrelEv) to get everything done_(UnrelEv) in one day so I had worked_(UnrelEv) very hard for a very long time .
 However , when I went_(UnrelEv) inside to clean_(Evoking) up_(Evoking) , I realized_(UnrelEv) from an automated_(UnrelEv) message in my voice mail that the water had been shut_(UnrelEv) off temporarily for emergency repairs , it would be_(UnrelEv) on again in a few hours .
 I was frustrated_(UnrelEv) , but I decided_(UnrelEv) that I was_(UnrelEv) hungry as well so I made_(UnrelEv) myself a sandwich and cut_(UnrelEv) up some fruit to eat_(UnrelEv) .
 I took_(ScrEv_undress) off my dirty clothes and put_(ScrEv_other) them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put_(UnrelEv) down an old blanket on my couch before I sat_(UnrelEv) on it so I would not get_(UnrelEv) it dirty .
 I watched_(UnrelEv) part of a baseball game until I could not stand_(UnrelEv) my own stench any more .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to try_(UnrelEv) the water in my bath tub and was_(UnrelEv) extremely glad when it worked_(UnrelEv) .
 I ran_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) myself a hot bath and put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some bubble bath soap in it .
 I got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in and found_(UnrelEv) it very relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .
 I was_(UnrelEv) so glad to finally take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) , get cleaned_(RelNScrEv) up , and relax_(ScrEv_relax) after a long , hard , productive day .

 I had been_(UnrelEv) out working_(UnrelEv) in the garden and was_(UnrelEv) quite dirty , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) into the bathroom and plugged_(ScrEv_close_drain) the hole , so the water would fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot water and I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the cold water until it was_(ScrEv_check_temp) a pleasant temperature .

 I got_(UnrelEv) undressed_(ScrEv_undress) and stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the bath tub .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) soap and a washcloth to clean_(ScrEv_wash) myself .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) shampoo to clean_(ScrEv_wash) my hair then I put_(ScrEv_wash) conditioner in , so that my hair would be_(UnrelEv) soft and silky .
 I let_(UnrelEv) the conditioner soak_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) for awhile and then I rinsed_(ScrEv_wash) it out .
 I rinsed_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) the soap from my body and got_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) of the tub .

 Every night before putting_(UnrelEv) my son to bed he gets_(Evoking) his_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 we go_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) up to the bathroom and I start_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water and add_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) his favorite bubbles .
 After he is undressed_(ScrEv_undress) he stands_(UnrelEv) next to the tub and giggles_(UnrelEv) and dances_(UnrelEv) watching_(UnrelEv) the running_(RelNScrEv) water create_(UnrelEv) a mass of bubbles !
 I make_(UnrelEv) sure the water is_(UnrelEv) warm enough , because his baths tend_(UnrelEv) to last_(RelNScrEv) a bit longer than most .
 When the water is_(UnrelEv) ready , he throws_(UnrelEv) in all his tub toys , lizards and dinosaurs , cups and cars .
 The cars are_(UnrelEv) his under water taxi 's for the fish , he says_(UnrelEv) .
 He sits_(ScrEv_sink_water) amiss the bubbles playing_(UnrelEv) with his toys and laughing_(UnrelEv) .
 We do_(UnrelEv) the toe test , which is when i look_(UnrelEv) at his toes and if they are wrinkle_(UnrelEv) then time is_(UnrelEv) up .
 Yup toes are wrinkled_(UnrelEv) , he laughs_(UnrelEv) as wash_(ScrEv_wash) his body and hair .
 I let_(ScrEv_open_drain) the water out as he sits_(UnrelEv) there and waits_(UnrelEv) for the tub to empty_(RelNScrEv) , only then does he want_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out .
 He helps_(UnrelEv) to dry_(ScrEv_dry) himself off and put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) his pajamas on .

 I carefully stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub , immersed_(ScrEv_sink_water) myself , and remained_(ScrEv_relax) there for more than half an hour relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .

 It 's_(UnrelEv) a very simple process and recommended_(UnrelEv) only if you have_(UnrelEv) some time to yourself .
 Make sure to let everyone know_(UnrelEv) that you are going to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) , and not to bother_(UnrelEv) you .
 This works_(UnrelEv) out much better if you are_(UnrelEv) home alone .
 Head_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) into your bathroom , and set_(ScrEv_close_drain) the tub up to stop_(UnrelEv) the water from draining_(RelNScrEv) .
 Turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot water on and let the tub fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up .
 If you would rather a cold bath_(Evoking) then maybe a bath_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) n't the best choice for you .
 While the water is running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) make_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) yourself a nice drink but if you are_(UnrelEv) underage then sparkling_(UnrelEv) grape juice works_(UnrelEv) great .
 You can also light_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a candle and bring_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) it in with you .
 Once the tub is_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) full enter_(ScrEv_sink_water) the tub and immediately feel_(ScrEv_relax) the stress levels dropping_(ScrEv_relax) .
 Once you have determined_(UnrelEv) you are finished_(UnrelEv) you can pull_(ScrEv_open_drain) the plug and watch_(UnrelEv) the water and your problems drain_(RelNScrEv) away_(RelNScrEv) !

 This morning I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) nice_(Evoking) ,_(Evoking) long_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) rather than rushing_(UnrelEv) through the shower .
 I walked_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) in_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) and put_(ScrEv_close_drain) a stopper in the bathtub drain , turning_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) a mix of hot and cold water and checking_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature after a couple of seconds to make_(ScrEv_check_temp) sure_(ScrEv_check_temp) it was_(UnrelEv) just right - I like_(UnrelEv) my water a little bit hot , but not too hot !
 After sitting_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) and waiting_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) for several minutes for the bathtub to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) it off and got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in_(ScrEv_sink_water) .
 After relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) for a few minutes , I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) the body wash and rag I keep_(UnrelEv) on the corner of the bathtub .
 I lathered_(ScrEv_apply_soap) it up and washed_(ScrEv_wash) my arms , my legs , my back , and my front , letting_(UnrelEv) the water in the tub rinse_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) any soap when I was_(UnrelEv) done with a part .
 After that , I pulled_(ScrEv_open_drain) the stopper and drained_(RelNScrEv) the tub , used_(UnrelEv) the towel hanging_(UnrelEv) in the bathroom to dry_(ScrEv_dry) myself off , and put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) on_(ScrEv_get_dressed) a fresh , clean pair of clothes .

 I needed_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the cold and hot taps to let_(UnrelEv) the bathtub fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) with warm water .
 Then I got_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel and draped_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) it over the curtain rod .
 I took_(ScrEv_undress) off_(ScrEv_undress) my clothes and grabbed_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) my favorite rubber ducky from a shelf .
 I dropped_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) him into the tub .
 If I needed_(RelNScrEv) a bath , so did_(UnrelEv) he .
 I also poured_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some bubble bath into the tub as it was filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) with water .
 It foamed_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) into lots of bubbles .
 When the tub was_(UnrelEv) full enough , I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) off_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the water and got_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub , being_(UnrelEv) careful not to slip_(RelNScrEv) on the slippery porcelain .
 I lay_(ScrEv_relax) back_(ScrEv_relax) in the warm water and shut_(ScrEv_relax) my eyes , relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .
 When the water started_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) cold , I stood_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) up_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) and grabbed_(ScrEv_get_towel) the towel from the curtain rod .
 I draped_(ScrEv_dry) it around myself and then opened_(ScrEv_open_drain) the tub 's drain so the water could drain_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 I went_(ScrEv_leave) off_(ScrEv_leave) to get dressed_(ScrEv_get_dressed) , and when I was done I went_(RelNScrEv) back_(RelNScrEv) to the bathroom and turned_(RelNScrEv) the shower on for a minute so the bubbles would all go_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) the drain .
 I picked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) my rubber ducky and gave_(UnrelEv) him a squeeze until he quacked_(UnrelEv) .
 Then I put_(RelNScrEv) him on the shelf until next time .

 A few weeks ago , I took_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I do not normally take_(Evoking) baths_(Evoking) , instead I take_(UnrelEv) showers , but I had_(UnrelEv) the house to myself .

 I start_(UnrelEv) out cleaning_(ScrEv_other) up the bathtub .
 It is_(UnrelEv) not dirty really , but I want_(UnrelEv) the tub to be_(UnrelEv) spotless if I am going to be taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I first took_(ScrEv_other) a quick shower to get everything washed_(ScrEv_wash) off and clean .

 After that was finished_(UnrelEv) , I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on the hot water and filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub .
 I like_(UnrelEv) to have_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) really_(Evoking) hot_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) , because it generally gets_(RelNScrEv) cold so quick .
 I found_(UnrelEv) some of my daughter 's bubble bath and added_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) a pretty generous amount .

 So , I got_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) it and folded_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel for my head and laid_(ScrEv_sink_water) down .
 I had_(UnrelEv) a beer while I was relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) in the tub .

 I would play_(UnrelEv) with my toys and get_(UnrelEv) all clean in the bath tub .
 After a few years I learned_(UnrelEv) how to wash_(ScrEv_wash) my own hair and I would prefer_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) over a shower since it was_(UnrelEv) more fun to sit_(UnrelEv) and relax_(ScrEv_relax) in the warm water and enjoy_(UnrelEv) a fun evening .
 From the best of my memory , I remember_(UnrelEv) that I always loved_(UnrelEv) taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 Then when I am done_(UnrelEv) in the bath tub , I would get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out and wrap_(ScrEv_get_towel) up in a huge dry cotton towel and dry_(ScrEv_dry) off !

 Last night I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) instead of a shower .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure to put_(ScrEv_close_drain) the stopper in the bathtub , so no water would drain_(RelNScrEv) out .
 Then I adjusted_(ScrEv_check_temp) the water temperature so it was_(UnrelEv) n't too hot , or too cold , then let_(UnrelEv) the bathtub fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) all the way up to the top .
 I then gathered_(ScrEv_take_clean_clothes) up my pajamas to put_(RelNScrEv) on after the bath was_(UnrelEv) over .
 I got_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a clean towel , and brought_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) everything into the bathroom .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_temp) the water temperature , took_(ScrEv_undress) all my clothes off , and jumped_(ScrEv_sink_water) right in .
 I lounged_(ScrEv_relax) around in the tub for awhile , then soaped_(ScrEv_apply_soap) up my hair and rinsed_(ScrEv_wash) it off .
 Then I cleaned_(ScrEv_wash) my body with a bar of soap until I had_(UnrelEv) every single part clean .
 At this point the water was starting_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) a bit cold , so I decided_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) time to get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out .
 I pulled_(ScrEv_open_drain) the water stopper so the water would drain_(RelNScrEv) out , then I dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself off with the towel , and got_(ScrEv_get_dressed) into my pajamas .

 I went_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) into the bathroom put_(ScrEv_close_drain) the plug into the drain and turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the water on in the tub so it would fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) with water .
 Then I got undressed_(ScrEv_undress) and grabbed_(ScrEv_get_towel) a towel to use_(UnrelEv) when I was done_(UnrelEv) .
 I got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in the tub and once it was_(UnrelEv) full of hot water I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) off the tap .
 I got_(ScrEv_other) my hair wet and shampooed_(ScrEv_other) my hair and applied_(ScrEv_other) some conditioner then washed_(ScrEv_wash) my body using_(UnrelEv) some liquid body wash .

 After a long day at school followed_(UnrelEv) by soccer practice , taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) one of the most relaxing and enjoyable parts of my day .
 First , I fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub with warm water .
 I like_(UnrelEv) the water to be_(UnrelEv) the perfect temperature ; not too hot , but not too cold .
 Sometimes I pour_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some bubble bath under the running_(RelNScrEv) faucet .
 The bubbles are_(UnrelEv) fun and relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) , not to mention they smell_(UnrelEv) good too .
 While the water runs_(RelNScrEv) , I grab_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a large towel and washcloth , placing_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) them near the tub .
 After undressing_(ScrEv_undress) , I step_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub and enjoy_(UnrelEv) the warmth of the soapy water .
 I pour_(ScrEv_apply_soap) some shampoo on my palm , place_(UnrelEv) my hands on my head , and rub_(ScrEv_wash) vigorously .
 Then I rinse_(ScrEv_wash) the shampoo out of my hair , and repeat_(ScrEv_wash) the process with conditioner .
 Finally , I take_(UnrelEv) a bar of soap and clean_(ScrEv_wash) my entire body , using_(UnrelEv) a washcloth to scrub_(RelNScrEv) .

 '' After playing_(UnrelEv) football with my friends , I was_(UnrelEv) all sweaty and dirty , so I decide_(UnrelEv) I should take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 First I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) there were_(UnrelEv) clean towels available and enough soap and shampoo to thoroughly clean_(ScrEv_wash) my skin and hair .
 I put_(ScrEv_close_drain) the plug in the bottom of the bath tub and turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water , being_(UnrelEv) careful to adjust_(ScrEv_check_temp) the water to a nice warm , but no too hot , temperature .
 I used_(UnrelEv) my finger to determine_(ScrEv_check_temp) just the right temperature .
 After removing_(ScrEv_undress) my clothes and placing_(RelNScrEv) them in the hamper , I carefully stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub , being_(UnrelEv) sure to steady_(UnrelEv) myself as I entered_(ScrEv_sink_water) .
 I gingerly lowered_(ScrEv_sink_water) myself into the nice warm water and immediately began_(UnrelEv) to relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 After a few minutes of rest and relaxation , I got_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) the soap and thoroughly washed_(ScrEv_wash) my whole body , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) all of the dirt and grass stains off that I had accumulated_(UnrelEv) from playing_(UnrelEv) football .
 Next I washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair with shampoo and laid_(RelNScrEv) back_(RelNScrEv) into the water to really rinse_(RelNScrEv) it out well .
 I carefully exited_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) the bath tub , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to step_(RelNScrEv) onto the bath mat so I would n't slip_(UnrelEv) on the smooth floor tiles , and got_(RelNScrEv) a towel and dried_(ScrEv_dry) myself off .

 Last night , I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I usually take_(RelNScrEv) a shower instead , but my muscles felt_(UnrelEv) sore and I thought_(UnrelEv) I could use_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) with some epsom salt .
 The epsom salt bath_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) really good at soothing sore muscles , plus it is very relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .
 I ran_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) a very hot bath and poured_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) some epsom salt in so it could dissolve_(RelNScrEv) .
 While the bath was running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I grabbed_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel and a book I was reading_(UnrelEv) .
 I set_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) it all up next to the tub and undressed_(ScrEv_undress) .
 I slid_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the hot water and felt_(RelNScrEv) the salt granules prickling_(RelNScrEv) my skin , as my muscles finally relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) .
 After some time , the water cooled_(RelNScrEv) , so I added_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) some more hot water .
 I stayed_(ScrEv_other) in the bathtub for about 45 minutes , until my muscles felt_(RelNScrEv) better .
 When I was finally done_(UnrelEv) , I drained_(ScrEv_open_drain) the cooled_(RelNScrEv) water , toweled_(ScrEv_dry) off , and got_(ScrEv_get_dressed) dressed .

 I went_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) to the bathroom .
 I removed_(ScrEv_undress) my clothes .
 Then I started_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water and adjusted_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature with the faucet .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) some bath oils and put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) them in the water .
 Once the water was_(UnrelEv) high enough , I stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very warm .
 I slid_(ScrEv_sink_water) my body underneath the water .
 Steam drifted_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) from the surface of the water .
 I felt_(UnrelEv) my muscles loosening_(ScrEv_relax) up_(ScrEv_relax) and relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .
 The bath oils gave_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) a minty aroma .
 After some time luxuriating_(ScrEv_relax) in the water , I took_(RelNScrEv) my washcloth and put_(ScrEv_apply_soap) some soap on it .
 I began_(UnrelEv) to soap_(ScrEv_wash) up_(ScrEv_wash) my skin .
 I started_(UnrelEv) with my face , then worked_(ScrEv_wash) my way down to my feet .

 I had_(UnrelEv) some sore muscles so I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 First , I showered_(RelNScrEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) the dirt off me .
 Then I stepped_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) to the bathtub and stopped_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the faucet on its hottest setting .
 As the steamy water was running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I opened_(RelNScrEv) my bathroom cabinet and found_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a box of bubble soap .
 I poured_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) a little bit of the powder into the tub and the water started_(UnrelEv) to foam_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) .
 The bubbles smelled_(RelNScrEv) like lavender and it was_(UnrelEv) very relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) .
 When the tub was filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) off_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) the faucet and stepped_(RelNScrEv) away_(RelNScrEv) to give_(UnrelEv) the water a chance to cool_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) a bit .
 I found_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) my magazine and poured_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) myself a glass of juice .
 I tied_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) my hair into a ponytail and got_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a towel and my robe and slippers to put_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) next to the tub for when I was_(UnrelEv) ready to get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) .

 It felt_(ScrEv_check_temp) warm but not too hot .
 I slipped_(ScrEv_sink_water) my body under the foam and relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) .
 I read_(RelNScrEv) my magazine and soaked_(ScrEv_relax) in the lavender bubbles .
 When the water started_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) too cold , I stood_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) up_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) and grabbed_(ScrEv_get_towel) my towel .
 I patted_(ScrEv_dry) myself dry and then put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) on_(ScrEv_get_dressed) my robe and slippers .

 I prefer_(UnrelEv) a shower over a bath , but when I need to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) it 's_(UnrelEv) to relax_(ScrEv_relax) from a stressful evening .
 Taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) requires_(UnrelEv) filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the whole tub up with warm water .
 This may take_(UnrelEv) some time and I will have to be_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to have_(ScrEv_close_drain) a stopper to prevent_(ScrEv_close_drain) the water from draining_(RelNScrEv) away_(RelNScrEv) from the tub .
 While the water is filling_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I will add_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) the bubble bath solution to make_(UnrelEv) the water soapy and fragrant .
 The aroma in the bath is_(UnrelEv) what de-stresses_(ScrEv_relax) me .
 Usually it 'll be_(UnrelEv) a nice lavender smell or something not too strong but is_(UnrelEv) very pleasant to smell_(RelNScrEv) .
 Once the tub is filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I will slowly enter_(ScrEv_sink_water) myself into the water .
 This can be_(UnrelEv) tough at first because the water is_(UnrelEv) usually too hot in the beginning so I will ease_(RelNScrEv) myself in .
 But once in , the bath will really work_(UnrelEv) to help_(UnrelEv) get_(UnrelEv) the blood circulating_(RelNScrEv) to get_(ScrEv_relax) a nice feeling of relaxation .
 I will typically stay_(ScrEv_relax) in_(ScrEv_relax) until the water is_(UnrelEv) no longer warm or the bubbles have gone_(RelNScrEv) away_(RelNScrEv) .
 So when the water is_(UnrelEv) just lukewarm , I will drain_(ScrEv_open_drain) the tub and then rinse_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) using_(UnrelEv) the normal shower .

 After I planted_(UnrelEv) a tree the other day , I was_(UnrelEv) all dirty and tired .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) for a change that instead of a shower I was going to have_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) tonight and relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 First I moved_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) my soap and shampoo down to the side of the tub instead of on their normal shower shelf , then started_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water running_(RelNScrEv) .
 Once I got_(UnrelEv) it hot , but not too hot , I closed_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain so the tub would start to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up .
 I had_(UnrelEv) an idea at the last minute and grabbed_(UnrelEv) my tablet and a ziploc bag and put_(UnrelEv) the tablet inside it to protect_(UnrelEv) it from splashes .
 I turned_(UnrelEv) up my stereo so I could head_(UnrelEv) it in the bathroom , then got_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub .
 I settled_(UnrelEv) into the warm water and relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) for a little while , then grabbed_(UnrelEv) my tablet and started_(UnrelEv) reading_(UnrelEv) a book .
 After about 30 minutes of relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) , I let_(ScrEv_other) some of the water out since it was getting_(RelNScrEv) cold , filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up with more hot water and started_(UnrelEv) washing_(ScrEv_wash) .
 Once I was cleaned_(UnrelEv) off , I opened_(ScrEv_open_drain) the drain and finished_(UnrelEv) up by washing_(ScrEv_wash) my hair under the shower .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a nice change from showering_(UnrelEv) all the time .

 We had just come_(UnrelEv) home from the beach one Saturday afternoon .
 We had_(UnrelEv) a great time , but were_(UnrelEv) very sweaty , sandy and sticky with old sunscreen , sweat and salt from the ocean .
 After unpacking_(UnrelEv) the car , I had to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 I love_(UnrelEv) our deep soaking tub .
 I put_(ScrEv_close_drain) in_(ScrEv_close_drain) the drain plug and started_(UnrelEv) running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the water , making_(ScrEv_check_temp) sure_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature of the water was_(UnrelEv) just right , and put_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) in_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) my favorite bath scents and soap .
 When the tub was_(UnrelEv) full , I immersed_(ScrEv_sink_water) myself deep into the tub and just let_(UnrelEv) my body soak_(RelNScrEv) for a while .
 It was_(UnrelEv) good to sit_(ScrEv_relax) in the nice , warm water and let_(UnrelEv) everything just relax_(ScrEv_relax) and melt_(UnrelEv) away_(UnrelEv) from me .
 I washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had_(UnrelEv) a lot of sand in it from playing_(UnrelEv) at the beach that day .
 I scrubbed_(ScrEv_wash) my body well with a washcloth , to get_(UnrelEv) off_(UnrelEv) all the sand and ocean salt that had dried_(UnrelEv) on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using_(UnrelEv) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very relaxing and I felt_(UnrelEv) really good .
 I then pulled_(ScrEv_open_drain) the drain on the tub and let_(UnrelEv) all the dirty water go_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) .
 I had_(UnrelEv) a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried_(ScrEv_dry) off_(ScrEv_dry) in , and I put_(ScrEv_get_dressed) on_(ScrEv_get_dressed) clean clothes .

 While washing_(ScrEv_wash) them , I glanced_(RelNScrEv) at myself in the mirror and realized_(UnrelEv) that I was_(UnrelEv) much dirtier than I thought .
 I figured_(UnrelEv) I should take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) before doing_(UnrelEv) anything else so as to not soil_(RelNScrEv) anything in my home .

 Once I had_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) the items I needed_(UnrelEv) , I went_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) back to the bathroom and turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the tub on .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the hot and cold nozzles both , and adjusted_(RelNScrEv) them as needed_(UnrelEv) after testing_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature with my hand .
 Once the tub was_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) half full I turned_(ScrEv_turn_water_off) it off , as I knew_(UnrelEv) my body weight would displace_(RelNScrEv) the water and cause_(UnrelEv) the level to rise_(RelNScrEv) once I got_(ScrEv_sink_water) in .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sink_water) down in the perfectly warm water and relaxed_(ScrEv_relax) .
 Once the water started cooling_(RelNScrEv) down , I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) ahead and wash_(ScrEv_wash) myself .
 I poured_(ScrEv_apply_soap) some bodywash on a cloth and washed_(ScrEv_wash) from the top down .

 Taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) actually a long process involving many steps .
 First I must start drawing_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water which is_(UnrelEv) a challenge in itself as I want_(UnrelEv) to make_(ScrEv_check_temp) sure it warm , but not too warm .
 Next as the water is still running_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) I add_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) a little bit of bubble soap for the added_(UnrelEv) benefits .
 But I do n't just want_(UnrelEv) bubbles I want_(UnrelEv) a relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) aromatherapy .
 With this in mind I add_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) a little bit of essential oils and minerals .
 Finally I am_(UnrelEv) ready to get_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the water .
 But this is_(UnrelEv) nowhere near the end of the process .

 I prefer_(UnrelEv) showers but sometimes you just need to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 Showers are_(UnrelEv) good for when you are_(UnrelEv) really dirty and need to get_(UnrelEv) cleaned fast but baths are_(UnrelEv) more leisurely and relaxing .
 First I go_(ScrEv_enter_bathroom) in the bathroom and put_(ScrEv_close_drain) a stopper in the bathtub to stop_(UnrelEv) the water from running_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 Then I start_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) up_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub .
 I also make_(ScrEv_check_temp) sure_(ScrEv_check_temp) it is_(UnrelEv) just right , not too hot or cold .
 Then I get_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) my face cloth and a great big bar of soap .
 If I feel_(UnrelEv) playful I will grab_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a couple water toys to play_(RelNScrEv) with .
 Then I slip_(ScrEv_undress) -LRB-_(ScrEv_undress) off_(ScrEv_undress) my clothes and slip_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub .
 I fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub really high so only my head sticks_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) above the water .
 I like_(UnrelEv) the hot water all over me .
 I will spend_(UnrelEv) an hour soaking_(RelNScrEv) in the tub .
 I will sit_(ScrEv_relax) there till my fingers get_(UnrelEv) all shrivelled and pruney .
 Then I use_(UnrelEv) my toes to take_(ScrEv_open_drain) out_(ScrEv_open_drain) the stopper and sit_(RelNScrEv) there till the water all drains_(RelNScrEv) away_(RelNScrEv) .

 Each night after we finish_(UnrelEv) eating_(UnrelEv) our dinner , I go_(UnrelEv) upstairs to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bath_(Evoking) .
 The first thing that I do_(UnrelEv) is_(UnrelEv) get_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) myself a clean towel and wash cloth .
 I put_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) these items on the side of the bath tub in my bathroom .
 I then put_(ScrEv_close_drain) the stopper in the drain of the bathtub and turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) on_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water faucet .
 I wait_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) for the water to warm_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) and check_(ScrEv_check_temp) it with my hand to make_(ScrEv_check_temp) sure_(ScrEv_check_temp) it is_(UnrelEv) warm and not too hot .
 Once the bath tub is_(UnrelEv) half way full , I turn_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) off_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the water .

 I draw_(Unclear) the bath by running_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) warm water into the tub and then adding_(ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent) my favorite bath salts and bubble bath .
 I light_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) some candles for a nice lighting effect and to add_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) some aromatherapy and fragrance to the room to help_(UnrelEv) me relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 I also gather_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a few of my favorite magazines to read_(RelNScrEv) while I am_(UnrelEv) in the bath .
 As soon as the water filled_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) the tub and at the right temperature , I get_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the tub and let_(UnrelEv) the bath salts and bubbles relax_(ScrEv_relax) me .
 I will spend_(RelNScrEv) some time in the tub closing_(RelNScrEv) my eyes , relaxing_(ScrEv_relax) , and then reading_(RelNScrEv) my magazines .

 I put_(ScrEv_close_drain) the stopper in the drain and adjusted_(ScrEv_check_temp) the temperature of the water .
 I allowed_(UnrelEv) the tub to fill_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) about two-thirds of the way full and stepped_(ScrEv_sink_water) inside .
 I sank_(ScrEv_sink_water) into the warm water with a sigh .
 The water felt_(UnrelEv) great and helped_(UnrelEv) me relax_(ScrEv_relax) .
 I grabbed_(UnrelEv) a wash cloth from the side of the tub and rubbed_(ScrEv_apply_soap) the soap against the cloth .
 I worked_(ScrEv_apply_soap) it into a rich lather and preceded_(UnrelEv) to wash_(ScrEv_wash) my entire body from the head down .

 After a long day , nothing really relaxes_(ScrEv_relax) me like a long , soaking_(RelNScrEv) bath .
 The entire activity for me is_(UnrelEv) something I enjoy_(UnrelEv) and start_(UnrelEv) looking_(UnrelEv) forward to before_(UnrelEv) I 've even left_(UnrelEv) work .
 First I 'll get_(UnrelEv) home and start_(ScrEv_turn_water_on) the tub ... I like_(UnrelEv) the water to be_(UnrelEv) hot to the point of nearly scalding , so I only add_(ScrEv_other) a tiny bit of cold water .
 As the tub fills_(ScrEv_fill_water/wait) , I get_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) together what I call_(UnrelEv) my bath toys , which consist_(UnrelEv) of my Kindle and an ice cold beer .
 When the tub is_(UnrelEv) full I get_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) my favorite sweat pants and sweatshirt together and , after getting_(ScrEv_undress) undressed , I slowly lower_(ScrEv_sink_water) myself into the tub , savoring_(UnrelEv) every twitch as I lower_(ScrEv_sink_water) myself into the scalding water .
 Once I 'm settled_(UnrelEv) , I crack_(UnrelEv) open my beer and then just enjoy_(UnrelEv) the feeling of all of the tension leaving_(UnrelEv) my muscles as I read_(UnrelEv) .
 When the water cools_(RelNScrEv) off -LRB- this can take_(UnrelEv) 30 minutes or more -RRB- I get_(ScrEv_get_out_bath) out of the tub , dry_(ScrEv_dry) off and get_(ScrEv_get_dressed) dressed , but not without a slight feeling of disappointment that the experience has ended_(UnrelEv) .

 I pour_(ScrEv_prepare_bath) a glass of wine while the water runs_(RelNScrEv) , and bring_(UnrelEv) it with me into the bathroom .

 I sip_(RelNScrEv) on my wine and enjoy_(UnrelEv) the soft popping_(RelNScrEv) bubbles around me .

 I applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) some adhesive from the kit and put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) on_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a rubber patch .
 Then I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) down_(ScrEv_get_tools) my bicycle pump .
 I hooked_(ScrEv_pull_air_pin) the hose up to the nipple on the tire and then pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) up and down vigorously for a few minutes .
 I felt_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) the tire .
 It was_(UnrelEv) nice and firm .
 Success !
 I put_(ScrEv_other) away_(ScrEv_other) the pump and kit and hopped_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on_(ScrEv_ride_bike) for my bike ride .

 Repairing_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) can be_(UnrelEv) a little tiring_(UnrelEv) , if you get_(UnrelEv) my drift .
 Anyway , the last time I had to do_(Evoking) this was when I 'd apparently ran_(ScrEv_other) over some random , sharp piece of metal that got_(RelNScrEv) stuck in my front tire .
 I had to get_(ScrEv_get_tools) some sealant and a little oil for my tire pump .
 I flipped_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) by bike upside down and used_(RelNScrEv) a wrench to take_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the whole tire off .
 I have_(UnrelEv) an older bike , so it 's_(UnrelEv) easier to do_(UnrelEv) it this way .
 I deflated_(ScrEv_other) the tire and then I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the outer tire off .
 I removed_(ScrEv_other) the metal bit from the tire and the bladder .
 I sealed_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the bladder and had to wait_(ScrEv_other) for it to cure_(RelNScrEv) .
 The outer tire got_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) little bit of repair mix too .
 After the various mixes dried_(RelNScrEv) , I inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the bladder a bit and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) both the bladder and the tire back on the wheel .
 This took_(RelNScrEv) a while , since I had to make_(UnrelEv) sure that it was_(UnrelEv) well within the wheel well , so that the tire would stay_(RelNScrEv) on .
 The last thing I really had to do_(UnrelEv) was fully inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the bladder and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the bike .
 It took_(RelNScrEv) a little while to do , but it was_(UnrelEv) better than buying_(RelNScrEv) an all new tire .

 I went_(UnrelEv) out to my garage to get_(RelNScrEv) my bike to go_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on a ride .
 When I saw_(RelNScrEv) my bike I realized_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that one of the tires were_(UnrelEv) flat .
 I needed to buy_(ScrEv_get_tire) a new tube in order to fix_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) .
 I drove_(RelNScrEv) to the local bike shop and purchased_(ScrEv_get_tire) a tube that would fit_(RelNScrEv) my bike 's tire and then I drove_(RelNScrEv) back home .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tire) the tube out of the packaging and read_(RelNScrEv) the instructions on how to put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it on the bike .
 I removed_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire from the bike and took_(ScrEv_remove_tire) out the old tube that was punctured_(RelNScrEv) .
 I then inserted_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the new tube onto the tire .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the bike and pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) up_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tube with air until it was filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) to the desired_(UnrelEv) fill weight .
 I got_(RelNScrEv) on the bike to test_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) it and it was_(UnrelEv) in great shape .

 Yesterday I wanted_(UnrelEv) to ride_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) to my friends house .
 The weather was_(UnrelEv) nice and I had n't used_(UnrelEv) my bicycle in a while .
 When I got_(RelNScrEv) to my garage I realized_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that I had_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) front_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 First I checked_(ScrEv_examine_tire) if there were_(RelNScrEv) any holes in my tire but there were_(RelNScrEv) n't .
 That was_(UnrelEv) good because it meant_(UnrelEv) that the tire only needed_(UnrelEv) more air .
 I then went_(UnrelEv) looking_(ScrEv_get_tools) for the air pump .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) it on one of the shelves .
 I took_(ScrEv_pull_air_pin) the cap off the tire valve .
 I put_(ScrEv_get_tools) the pump onto the tire valve and began_(UnrelEv) pumping_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) in air .
 After a few seconds I grabbed_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) the tire to see_(UnrelEv) how much more air was needed_(UnrelEv) .
 I did_(UnrelEv) this until I had pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it up enough .
 I then took_(RelNScrEv) the pump off the valve and put_(RelNScrEv) the cap back onto the valve .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) the pump back where I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) it and got_(ScrEv_other) on my bicycle .
 I cycled_(Evoking) to my friends house and we had_(UnrelEv) a fun time .

 Repairing_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) vital and I learned_(UnrelEv) how easy and important it is_(UnrelEv) through the many years I have rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) bicycles .
 First of all do not think_(UnrelEv) you ca n't do_(UnrelEv) it I will show_(UnrelEv) and you will be glad_(UnrelEv) you learned_(UnrelEv) the first time a tipe deflates_(RelNScrEv) way out on a country or something .
 First use_(UnrelEv) tire removing tools that are_(UnrelEv) flat and will not pop_(RelNScrEv) tires or tubes and have_(UnrelEv) a portable wrench .
 I use_(UnrelEv) small air pressure bulbs that I find_(UnrelEv) are_(UnrelEv) more convenient to use_(UnrelEv) for tire inflation but you can use_(UnrelEv) a hand pump .
 Simply remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the wheel and place_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the new tube in the tire being_(UnrelEv) careful to look_(ScrEv_other) for debris that might still be embedded_(UnrelEv) into the tire still .
 Then carefully tuck_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back into the rim and reinflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) .
 Its_(UnrelEv) a real good thing you now_(UnrelEv) how to change_(RelNScrEv) your tire because you never know_(UnrelEv) when a tube will pop_(RelNScrEv) or puncture_(RelNScrEv) and you can be_(UnrelEv) out of luck if you do n't have_(UnrelEv) your spare tube , tools , and pump .

 Yesterday , I wanted_(UnrelEv) to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike because the weather was_(UnrelEv) so nice .
 I got_(RelNScrEv) my bike out of the storage closet and noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) it had_(RelNScrEv) a flat tire .
 Since I do not have_(RelNScrEv) a spare tire , I had to fix_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) if I wanted_(UnrelEv) to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) my bike pump and patch kit .
 I pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire and was_(UnrelEv) able to locate_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the air leak .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) the patch and applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it to the part of the tire that had_(RelNScrEv) the little leak .
 I then pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire again .
 I had to be_(UnrelEv) careful not to overfill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire so the patch would n't pop_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) .
 Once I was_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the patch would n't come_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) , I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) that I pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the air into the tire sufficiently .
 I tested_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) the tire by sitting_(RelNScrEv) on the bike and riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) around a little .
 The tire seemed_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) to hold_(RelNScrEv) , so I was_(UnrelEv) ready to go_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on my bike ride .

 I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) my bicycle tire was_(UnrelEv) flat this morning when I pulled_(UnrelEv) it out of the garage to go_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on a ride .
 I took_(UnrelEv) the bike back into the garage and laid_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) it on it 's side .
 I thoroughly checked_(ScrEv_other) the tire to see_(UnrelEv) what had caused_(UnrelEv) it to go_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 I saw_(UnrelEv) no nails , holes or tears in the tire so I assumed_(UnrelEv) that the tire had simply lost_(RelNScrEv) air and needed_(UnrelEv) to be refilled_(RelNScrEv) .
 After then I went_(UnrelEv) into my tool chest until I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) my manual air pump .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) the pump back to where I my bicycle was_(UnrelEv) .
 I removed_(ScrEv_other) the cap on the tires stem and carefully set_(UnrelEv) it aside .
 I then inserted_(ScrEv_other) the pump needle into the stem and made_(UnrelEv) sure it fit_(UnrelEv) .
 I then placed_(ScrEv_other) the pump flat on the ground and began pumping_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into the tire , all the while monitoring_(RelNScrEv) the pressure gauge .
 When I saw_(UnrelEv) that the tire was properly inflated_(RelNScrEv) I removed_(ScrEv_other) the pump from the tire .
 I put_(ScrEv_other) the stem cap back onto the tire and went_(UnrelEv) out for a ride to make_(UnrelEv) sure the tire was_(UnrelEv) ok .

 The other day , my best friend and I were riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) to his house .
 When we were_(UnrelEv) almost there , I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that the front tire on my bicycle felt_(ScrEv_notice_problem) rather wobbly and was_(UnrelEv) most likely flat .
 I was_(UnrelEv) in luck however , as my friend had_(UnrelEv) a bicycle repair kit and some spare tires .
 Once we arrived_(UnrelEv) at my friend 's house , I asked_(UnrelEv) my friend if he let_(UnrelEv) me borrow_(UnrelEv) his bicycle repair kit .
 First , I turned_(RelNScrEv) the bike over and removed_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the front tire and tube .
 Next I filled_(RelNScrEv) the tube with air to check_(ScrEv_examine_tire) where the tube was_(UnrelEv) damaged , and found_(ScrEv_examine_tire) a small glass shard which had punctured_(RelNScrEv) through it .
 After making_(UnrelEv) ensure the tube was_(UnrelEv) fully deflated , I repaired_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the puncture in the tube by using_(UnrelEv) glue and applying_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a patch on top , then slid_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it back onto the tire using_(UnrelEv) my hands .
 Next , I placed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) and pushed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back onto the tube .
 After which , I reconnected_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire onto the bicycle .
 Finally , I pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into the tire until it was_(UnrelEv) filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) up_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) and the bicycle was_(UnrelEv) ready to be ridden_(ScrEv_ride_bike) again .

 I was riding_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) home when I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that it had_(ScrEv_notice_problem) a flat tire .
 Lucky for me there was_(UnrelEv) a hardware store near by .
 I walked_(UnrelEv) in and purchased_(ScrEv_get_tools) a patch kit .
 It was_(UnrelEv) only a few dollars .
 They loaned_(RelNScrEv) me a chanellock to get_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off .
 It came_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off easy and I pulled_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire off the rim .
 It had_(RelNScrEv) a nail hole so I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) the wire scrubber in the repair kit and scruffed_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up the rubber .
 I applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the risen and stuck_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) on the patch , and I held_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) thumb pressure on it for a few minutes .
 I started_(UnrelEv) putting_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the rim , which was_(UnrelEv) easy I got_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it back on the bike .
 Lucky for me the hardware store had_(RelNScrEv) a portable tire air filler and I was able to fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire .
 I thanked_(UnrelEv) them and finished_(RelNScrEv) my ride_(Evoking) home and the tire did_(RelNScrEv) great .

 At some point , one of my bike 's tires went_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) at a safe stopping point away from the highway and turned_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) my bicycle upside down .
 Sure enough , one of my tires was_(RelNScrEv) flat , the back tire specifically .
 This was_(UnrelEv) why I always carried_(ScrEv_get_tools) a small travel bag of tools .
 I set_(ScrEv_get_tools) down_(ScrEv_get_tools) the bag and began_(UnrelEv) to work_(RelNScrEv) .
 First I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) my tire .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a quick release which made_(UnrelEv) it very easy to take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) .
 I just moved_(RelNScrEv) a simple lever .

 One day my bicycle tire got_(RelNScrEv) flat due to hitting_(RelNScrEv) some glass in the street .
 I then had to walk_(RelNScrEv) the rest of the way home .
 I took_(RelNScrEv) it into my garage and tried_(UnrelEv) to repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) by putting_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) some duct tape on it and pumping_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it with air .
 This , however , only made_(UnrelEv) matters worst and all the air ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) making_(UnrelEv) another hole in my tire because I over_(RelNScrEv) inflated_(RelNScrEv) it .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) that I had_(UnrelEv) no other options and I ordered_(ScrEv_get_tools) a new tire on Amazon for my bike .
 Once that came_(UnrelEv) in the mail it was_(UnrelEv) time to repair_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) broken_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) a socket wrench and unscrewed_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the nut of the bike that attached_(UnrelEv) to the wheel .
 After that I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my new bike tire and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it on the frame of the bike and screwed_(ScrEv_other) it back on .

 To be_(UnrelEv) honest , when ever I have_(UnrelEv) a flat tire on anything , I usually leave_(UnrelEv) it to my husband , but he did teach_(UnrelEv) me how to fix_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) on a bike .
 Sometimes , it needs_(UnrelEv) a new inner tube .
 If that is_(UnrelEv) the issue , you must remove_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the outer rubber , and take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off the old broken inner tube .
 Then , put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) on the new one , out the rubber back on , and fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with air .
 Make sure that you check_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) the pressure when filling_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire so as to not put_(RelNScrEv) too much air in .
 Sometimes you will also need_(UnrelEv) to chance_(RelNScrEv) the outer tire as that may have_(UnrelEv) a hole .
 It can be hard to determine_(UnrelEv) which part of the tire is_(UnrelEv) the issue when you have_(RelNScrEv) a flat .
 First , you can check_(ScrEv_other) the tire pressure and fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it if low .
 If it quickly loses_(RelNScrEv) pressure again , then it was_(UnrelEv) n't just an issue with the tire pressure and you need to replace_(RelNScrEv) one of the tire pieces a s previously stated_(UnrelEv) .

 I began_(UnrelEv) to repair_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) by removing_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the wheel from the bike .
 This was done_(UnrelEv) by disconnecting_(RelNScrEv) the brake cable so the wheel would be able to be removed_(RelNScrEv) from the frame .
 I then loosened_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the bolts holding_(UnrelEv) it on and slid_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the axle off the frame , making_(UnrelEv) sure that the chain did not get_(RelNScrEv) caught or bind_(RelNScrEv) up while doing_(UnrelEv) so .
 After the wheel was removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) , I made_(UnrelEv) sure that all possible air was_(UnrelEv) out of the tube so that it would be_(UnrelEv) easier to remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) .
 I next took_(ScrEv_get_tools) two flat head screwdrivers and began_(UnrelEv) to remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire from the bicycle .
 After the tire was finally removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) , I pulled_(ScrEv_other) the tube off the rim as well .
 Next , I placed_(ScrEv_other) a new tube in place making_(UnrelEv) sure that the valve stem was placed_(RelNScrEv) through the rim appropriately .
 After doing_(UnrelEv) this , I began_(UnrelEv) to fit_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire to the rim , making_(UnrelEv) sure the tube was placed_(RelNScrEv) inside the tire and not pinched_(RelNScrEv) at all .
 Once the tire was_(UnrelEv) on the rim , I inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tube , making_(UnrelEv) sure that the tire seated_(RelNScrEv) onto the rim properly and that everything held_(RelNScrEv) air .

 Perhaps the tire has been punctured_(RelNScrEv) , or perhaps it is_(UnrelEv) an older tire and the seal is failing_(RelNScrEv) .

 We looked_(RelNScrEv) to see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) where bubbles came_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) ; where the bubbles came_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) told_(ScrEv_examine_tire) us where the hole was_(UnrelEv) .
 Once we noted_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the location of the hole we took_(RelNScrEv) the tube out of the tub and dried_(RelNScrEv) it .
 To put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) on_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the patch we had to put_(RelNScrEv) a glue on the tube and then put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) on_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the patch .
 We held_(RelNScrEv) it there a few minutes to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it would stay_(RelNScrEv) , then we let_(UnrelEv) it sit_(RelNScrEv) for an hour to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the glue would dry_(RelNScrEv) .
 To make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it dried_(RelNScrEv) well we placed_(RelNScrEv) the tube out in the sun so the the heat could help_(RelNScrEv) it along .
 To be_(UnrelEv) safe we waited_(RelNScrEv) a day .
 The next day we took_(RelNScrEv) the tube and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it back in the tire , then we put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire on the wheel .
 My bike was_(UnrelEv) good to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) again .

 When I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike this past summer , one of my tires went_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) it went_(RelNScrEv) flat because it felt_(ScrEv_notice_problem) bumpy while I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) down the street .
 I wheeled_(ScrEv_get_off) my bike home while walking_(RelNScrEv) next to it and pushing_(RelNScrEv) it .
 I asked_(RelNScrEv) my dad to help_(UnrelEv) me fix_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) because I had never done_(UnrelEv) it before .
 He gave_(ScrEv_get_tools) me the materials I needed_(UnrelEv) to fix_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) , and he explained_(RelNScrEv) how to go_(UnrelEv) about fixing_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 To my surprise , it was_(UnrelEv) very easy to fix_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 I just had to patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole with the materials he gave_(ScrEv_get_tools) me .
 After I patched_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole , I used_(RelNScrEv) an air pump to put_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air in both of my tires .
 This completed_(UnrelEv) the repair process for me .
 The next day , I rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike again and I did not have_(RelNScrEv) any problems with the tire .

 Yesterday on my way home from work I heard_(ScrEv_notice_problem) a loud popping noise and nearly lost_(UnrelEv) control of my bicycle .
 After coming_(UnrelEv) to a stop I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that my tire was flat .
 I ended_(UnrelEv) up having to walk_(ScrEv_other) my bike the rest of the way home as I did not have_(UnrelEv) any tools to repair_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) on the spot .
 Once I returned_(ScrEv_other) home I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) a can of spray foam that I thought_(UnrelEv) might do_(UnrelEv) the trick if I sprayed_(RelNScrEv) it into the tire .
 I sprayed_(ScrEv_other) the foam in and it filled_(RelNScrEv) the inside walls of the tire .
 I was_(UnrelEv) happy with my ingenuity , although I knew_(UnrelEv) this was_(UnrelEv) only a temporary fix and I should probably replace_(RelNScrEv) the tire .
 After the tire was filled_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) I hopped_(UnrelEv) on and rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) to my local bike shop where I purchased_(ScrEv_get_tire) a replacement tire to put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) on my bike at a later date .

 The other day my dad was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) his bike and started_(UnrelEv) having_(ScrEv_notice_problem) trouble steering_(RelNScrEv) .
 He rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) the bike back home and then took_(RelNScrEv) it into the back yard to have_(ScrEv_examine_tire) a look at it .
 He noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that the front tire was_(UnrelEv) flat and was n't keeping_(RelNScrEv) air in it .
 He took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) it off the bike .
 First he pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it up and tried_(UnrelEv) to see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) if the tire would hold_(RelNScrEv) air .
 It would_(UnrelEv) not .
 Then he rubbed_(RelNScrEv) liquid dish detergent on the tire and pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it up and looked_(ScrEv_examine_tire) for_(ScrEv_examine_tire) where it bubbled_(RelNScrEv) to see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) where the hole was_(UnrelEv) .
 Once he found_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the hole , he decided_(UnrelEv) if it needed_(RelNScrEv) a patch or a plug .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a small round hole so he decided_(UnrelEv) to put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a plug in it .
 He got_(ScrEv_get_tools) the packages of plugs and found_(RelNScrEv) one that was_(UnrelEv) the right size .
 He followed_(RelNScrEv) the instructs on the package to insert_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the plug into the hole and secure_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it .
 He pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire back up and it held_(RelNScrEv) air .
 He put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the bike .

 My friend Adam and I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) to the flea market today because the weather was_(UnrelEv) nice and we were hoping_(UnrelEv) to take_(UnrelEv) some random junk home with us .
 We walked_(UnrelEv) around for a while , but nothing really caught_(UnrelEv) our attention .
 We were looking_(UnrelEv) for_(UnrelEv) something special amount all this junk .
 Suddenly something caught_(UnrelEv) my eye , it was_(UnrelEv) an old Schwinn with a flat tire .
 The price was_(UnrelEv) right so I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(UnrelEv) it home with me .
 Fixing_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) a trivial task , I could do_(UnrelEv) it in my sleep .
 All I had to do_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) remove_(RelNScrEv) the brakes off the back wheel , then I needed to remove_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the wheel from the axle , next I would take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the old tube off of the rim and replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it with the new one , lastly I would just put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the axle and reattach_(RelNScrEv) the brakes .
 With this little amount of effort I would have_(UnrelEv) myself a brand new Schwinn .

 After getting_(RelNScrEv) a flat tire on my bicycle , I took_(ScrEv_other) my bike into the garage and placed_(ScrEv_other) it on my bike_(Evoking) repair_(Evoking) stand .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) all the necessary tools and items ready for repair_(Evoking) : my air compressor -LRB- smaller air compressor which serves_(RelNScrEv) as my air pump -RRB- , my Alan Key -LRB- Hex Key -RRB- , my spare tire , and tube repair just in case my tire could be saved_(UnrelEv) by patching_(RelNScrEv) the inner tube .
 After placing_(ScrEv_other) my bike on the stand , I was able to remove_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the back tire off of the rim and I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) how the inner tube of the tire could not be saved_(UnrelEv) .
 As a result , I tossed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the damaged tire to the side and picked_(ScrEv_get_tire) up the spare tire to place_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it on empty rim .
 After a few moments of fitting_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire to the rim and placing_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it correctly on , I was able to test_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) to see_(UnrelEv) if the tire would spin_(RelNScrEv) and roll_(RelNScrEv) correctly .
 I rode_(RelNScrEv) the tire around for a few minutes to get_(UnrelEv) a feel for the tire .
 The air was_(UnrelEv) low , so I had to pump_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it up an additional few pounds of air in order to get_(UnrelEv) it correct .
 The entire process only took_(RelNScrEv) me about ten-to-fifteen minutes to complete_(UnrelEv) , and I had_(UnrelEv) my new tire on my bike in no time .

 I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike along the road when a tire blew_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 I dragged_(RelNScrEv) it back to my garage and began_(UnrelEv) to repair_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) 's_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 I flipped_(RelNScrEv) the bike upside down and stood_(RelNScrEv) it up so that I could work_(RelNScrEv) on it from the bottom-up .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the old tire and began putting_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) on_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the new one that I had_(UnrelEv) around in my garage .

 As I was bring_(RelNScrEv) my bike out of the garage I realized_(ScrEv_notice_problem) the rear tire had_(RelNScrEv) flat and there was_(RelNScrEv) clearly a small hissing_(RelNScrEv) sound where there was_(RelNScrEv) a puncture .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my tools and loosened_(ScrEv_loose_nut) and removed_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the nuts holding_(RelNScrEv) the tire on the bike .
 Using_(RelNScrEv) a screwdriver I wedged_(RelNScrEv) underneath the tire removing_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) it from the metal wheel .
 I removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire tube and cleaned_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) the punctured_(RelNScrEv) area with a dry cloth .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) tire repair glue on the hole and placed_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a tire patch on the glue and held_(RelNScrEv) it tight for several minutes until the glue dried_(RelNScrEv) .
 I filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it up to ensure_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) the hole was not leaking_(RelNScrEv) any air .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tube back in the tire and re-attached_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it to the wheel tightening_(RelNScrEv) the bolts .
 Again I filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with air and took_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike for a ride .

 When I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike last week I must have ran_(RelNScrEv) over something sharp , because when I got_(RelNScrEv) home I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that the front tire was_(UnrelEv) flat .
 This was annoying_(UnrelEv) especially since I did n't have_(UnrelEv) the equipment to fix_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 So later that day I drove_(RelNScrEv) over to the local sports store and bought_(ScrEv_get_tire) a new tire inner tube and an air pump .
 When I got_(RelNScrEv) home I took_(ScrEv_remove_tire) out_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the old punctured_(RelNScrEv) inner tube from the tire and replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it with the new once .
 I then unscrewed_(ScrEv_pull_air_pin) the air cap on the tire and attached_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the air pump .
 I began_(UnrelEv) pumping_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into the tire , it took_(UnrelEv) about 30 pumps before it was fully filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) up_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) with air .
 I then got_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on the bike and tested_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) it to see_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) how it would hold_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) .
 It felt_(UnrelEv) good as new .
 I rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) around happy that it was fixed_(Evoking) , and also happy that I now had_(ScrEv_get_tools) the equipment to fix_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) again if it went_(RelNScrEv) flat in the future .

 I noticed_(UnrelEv) it was getting_(UnrelEv) warmer out and it would be_(UnrelEv) a nice time to exercise_(ScrEv_ride_bike) so I took_(RelNScrEv) my bicycle out to see_(UnrelEv) if it needed_(UnrelEv) any maintenance .
 At first everything looked_(UnrelEv) good and I was ready to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) but then I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that the front tire was_(RelNScrEv) a little flat .
 I had_(RelNScrEv) some tools in my garage so I picked_(RelNScrEv) up the bike and placed_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) it on my workbench .
 First I removed_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the wheel and checked_(ScrEv_examine_tire) as best I could_(UnrelEv) to make_(UnrelEv) sure there were_(UnrelEv) no tears or other types of damage .
 There was_(UnrelEv) just a very small tear so I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) out the patching kit that I 'd purchased_(ScrEv_get_tools) from the sports store last summer .
 I cleaned_(RelNScrEv) the area around the tear and applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the patch .
 After waiting_(RelNScrEv) for a while , I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on my bike and re-inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire .

 While riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) down the street I got_(RelNScrEv) a flat tire on my bike .
 I found_(ScrEv_examine_tire) out_(ScrEv_examine_tire) for sure that the tire was_(UnrelEv) actually flat by trying_(UnrelEv) to fill_(RelNScrEv) it up and see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) if it held_(UnrelEv) air .
 It did not stay_(UnrelEv) inflated so I thought_(UnrelEv) that I needed to replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the inner tube .
 I went_(UnrelEv) and got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my Dad 's adjustable wrench from the garage , hoping_(UnrelEv) he would not be_(UnrelEv) angry .
 I removed_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the wheel by loosening_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the two nuts using_(UnrelEv) the wrench and almost caught_(UnrelEv) my finger in the chain .
 After the wheel had been removed_(ScrEv_free_wheel) , I removed_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire and tube from the wheel rim and nearly cut_(UnrelEv) my hand again .
 I removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the old -LRB- flat -RRB- inner tube and replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it with a new tube that I bought_(RelNScrEv) at the store down the street .
 The guy at the store said_(UnrelEv) that if the hole was_(UnrelEv) small enough , I could possibly patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole using_(UnrelEv) a tire patch kit .
 I told_(UnrelEv) the man that the hole was_(UnrelEv) 2 inches long and he said_(UnrelEv) I needed to replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the inner tube-but I already figured_(UnrelEv) that out because it happened_(UnrelEv) last summer too .
 When I finally had_(UnrelEv) the new tube in the tire , I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the rim and made_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) sure_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) that the tube stem was_(UnrelEv) in the right place .
 I had_(UnrelEv) some lemonade and then I put_(ScrEv_other) the wheel back on the bike and tightened_(ScrEv_other) the nuts .
 Then I inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire and rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) to my friend Steve 's house to play_(UnrelEv) video games .

 While I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike I accidentally ran_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) a nail .
 My rear tire quickly deflated_(RelNScrEv) .
 I walked_(RelNScrEv) the bike home .
 My bike tire had_(UnrelEv) an inner tube , and I had_(UnrelEv) an extra one in my basement .
 I got_(RelNScrEv) the extra inner tube and went_(UnrelEv) to work .
 In order to fix_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) , I had to pry_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the rubber outer tire out of the wheel 's metal rim .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) a screwdriver and inserted_(RelNScrEv) it between the metal and rubber , lifting_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the rubber out .
 I went_(UnrelEv) around the rim that way taking_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire out of the rim .
 Once it was_(UnrelEv) out , I was able to pull_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the broken inner tube out .
 As I 'd figured_(UnrelEv) , there was_(UnrelEv) a big hole in it from the nail .
 I put_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the old inner tube aside and got_(RelNScrEv) the new one .
 There 's_(UnrelEv) a part on the tube where a valve comes_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) .
 That 's where you attach_(RelNScrEv) a pump to fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tube with air .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) this valve through the hole in the rim that it 's_(UnrelEv) supposed to stick_(UnrelEv) through_(UnrelEv) .
 Then I went_(UnrelEv) around the rim squeezing_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the inner tube into the tire .
 Once I had_(UnrelEv) the inner tube in place , I went_(UnrelEv) around the rim again pushing_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the outer part of the tire back into the rim .
 That was_(UnrelEv) hard work , but I finally managed_(UnrelEv) it .
 Once that was_(UnrelEv) done , I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) my bike pump , fitted_(RelNScrEv) it to the inner tube 's valve , and filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the new tire with air .
 Soon my tire was_(UnrelEv) completely repaired_(Evoking) and I was able to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) again !

 I carefully took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off of the rim and then inflated_(ScrEv_examine_tire) it with a hand pump so I could find_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the leak .
 A blast of cool air on my fingers led_(ScrEv_examine_tire) me to the problem : a single round hole , probably caused_(UnrelEv) by a nail or other sharp object .

 I went_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_tools) my spare inner tube as well as a screwdriver and wrench .
 I unbolted_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the wheel from the bicycle with the wrench .
 Then I used_(RelNScrEv) the screw driver to take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire and old inner tube out .
 I brought_(ScrEv_get_tire) out_(ScrEv_get_tire) the new inner tube and placed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it inside the tire , then put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) both back on the wheel and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the wheel on the bike .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) my air pump and filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with air until it was_(UnrelEv) firm .

 I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike the other day when I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) I was moving_(UnrelEv) slowly , even though I was pedaling_(UnrelEv) hard with a lot of effort .
 I stopped_(UnrelEv) and looked_(UnrelEv) at my front wheel and noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that it was squished_(RelNScrEv) down against the pavement and was_(UnrelEv) soft when I pressed_(RelNScrEv) it , instead of being_(UnrelEv) firm and tough .
 It did n't have_(UnrelEv) enough air in it to fill_(RelNScrEv) it up , like an old balloon .
 I took_(ScrEv_other) the bicycle home to my garage .
 Inside my garage was_(UnrelEv) my bicycle tire pump .
 The pump would put_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air back into the tire .
 On my front tire , there was_(UnrelEv) a tiny tube or straw that would let_(UnrelEv) the air in when I used_(UnrelEv) the pump .
 The pump also had_(UnrelEv) a long tube with a tiny metal fastener on the end .
 I stuck_(ScrEv_other) the metal part into the tube so that it can blow_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into my bicycle tire .
 The large metal cylinder part of the pump had_(UnrelEv) a handle sticking_(UnrelEv) out the top , which could be pulled_(UnrelEv) out like a pogo stick , and two little metal feet on the bottom .
 I stood_(UnrelEv) on the metal feet to keep_(UnrelEv) the pump in place .
 Then I carefully pulled_(ScrEv_other) the handle out and pushed_(ScrEv_other) it back in .
 A dial on the pump showed_(UnrelEv) me how much pressure I was putting_(RelNScrEv) into the pump by pushing_(ScrEv_other) on the handle , which then pushed_(ScrEv_other) the air in the tire .
 I heard it make_(RelNScrEv) a hissing noise .
 I kept pulling_(ScrEv_other) the handle out and pushing_(ScrEv_other) it back in , and noticed_(UnrelEv) that the tire was getting_(UnrelEv) bigger and bigger .
 Finally , after a few minutes , I pushed_(ScrEv_other) on the tire again .
 It was_(UnrelEv) firm and ready to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) .
 I disconnected_(ScrEv_other) the pump and put_(ScrEv_other) it away .
 Then I went_(UnrelEv) out to have fun_(UnrelEv) on my bike again , with my tire working perfectly .

 Yesterday , I found_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that my bicycle_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) was_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) and would have to be repaired_(Evoking) .
 First , I went_(RelNScrEv) to the store in town to purchase_(ScrEv_get_tools) a machine that would inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) my bike tire .
 Next , I went_(RelNScrEv) to my garage , which is_(UnrelEv) where I keep_(RelNScrEv) my bike .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) the nozzle in the bike tire where the air is supposed_(UnrelEv) to be pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) into .
 I plugged_(RelNScrEv) the machine into the wall socket and then attached_(RelNScrEv) the nozzle from the machine onto the nozzle on the bike .
 I hit_(RelNScrEv) the switch , which caused_(UnrelEv) the machine to beep_(RelNScrEv) as it added_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into the tire .
 I watched_(RelNScrEv) the gauge on the machine to make_(UnrelEv) sure there was_(RelNScrEv) n't too much pressure ; I did n't want_(UnrelEv) my tire to pop_(UnrelEv) like a balloon .
 Finally , when I saw_(UnrelEv) that there was_(RelNScrEv) enough air in the tire , I turned_(RelNScrEv) off the machine and removed_(RelNScrEv) it before closing_(RelNScrEv) the bike 's tire nozzle tight .
 Now my tire is_(UnrelEv) good as new and I can ride_(Evoking) around wherever I 'd like to go_(UnrelEv) .
 I 'm_(UnrelEv) glad I got this important job done_(UnrelEv) .

 As I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) home from school one day the worst possible thing that could happen_(UnrelEv) did happen_(UnrelEv) .
 My tire popped_(ScrEv_other) .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) I was_(UnrelEv) in deep because I had_(UnrelEv) no idea how to repair_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 Luckily my grandfather did_(UnrelEv) and with his advice we went_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_tire) a new tube for the rims of my bike 's tire .
 We arrive_(ScrEv_other) at the store and I am swamped_(UnrelEv) .
 There are_(UnrelEv) so many different kinds and sizes of tubes .
 Well luckily my grandfather had_(UnrelEv) already looked_(UnrelEv) before we had left_(UnrelEv) and knew_(UnrelEv) which kind we needed_(UnrelEv) .
 With that in mind we purchased_(ScrEv_get_tools) the one we needed_(UnrelEv) and returned_(UnrelEv) home ready to go_(UnrelEv) .
 My grandfather showed_(UnrelEv) me that to repair_(Evoking) a tire you need to take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off the old broken tube and the replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it with the new one .
 After that you take_(ScrEv_get_tools) a pump and pump_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into the tire until it is full .
 I was_(UnrelEv) n't prepared last time for my tire to pop_(RelNScrEv) but you can be_(UnrelEv) sure that I will be_(UnrelEv) the next

 I recently got_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) while riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) home from work .
 As soon as I got_(RelNScrEv) home , I removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire from the bike and checked_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) for the cause .
 Sure enough , there was_(RelNScrEv) a small puncture , I must have run_(RelNScrEv) over something sharp while commuting_(ScrEv_ride_bike) home .
 I then went_(RelNScrEv) to the local bike shop and the man at the shop recommended_(RelNScrEv) that I buy_(ScrEv_get_tools) a patch kit , since doing_(UnrelEv) so is_(UnrelEv) much cheaper than replacing_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) entire_(Evoking) tube_(Evoking) .
 The patch kit was_(UnrelEv) very easy to use_(UnrelEv) as the instructions were_(UnrelEv) very details .
 First I added_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) glue to the area and then put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the patch on top .
 After holding_(RelNScrEv) the patch in place for a few minutes , I added_(RelNScrEv) a little talc .
 I also added_(RelNScrEv) a little talc to the inside of the tire .
 Once everything was set_(RelNScrEv) , I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the wheel back on the bike and everything was_(UnrelEv) good as new .

 Some years ago , I used_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike to get_(UnrelEv) around town a lot .
 Of course , came_(UnrelEv) the time when you have to make_(Evoking) repairs_(Evoking) .
 I found_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) a lot about bicycle tires during this time .
 My tire had_(RelNScrEv) a leak so I bought_(ScrEv_get_tools) a repair kit .
 I had_(UnrelEv) no idea how to use_(UnrelEv) it but I did find_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) .
 I had to take_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the whole wheel off the bicycle .
 Next I pried_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tires from the rim and that took_(UnrelEv) some doing_(UnrelEv) .
 Okay once I got_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) that off I had to take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the inner tube out also and I learned_(UnrelEv) that I had to be_(UnrelEv) very careful with the inner tube because I could cause_(UnrelEv) more damage by being_(UnrelEv) rough .
 Next , I took_(UnrelEv) the inner tube to the gas station to get_(UnrelEv) air since I did n't have_(UnrelEv) a manual air pump .
 I learned_(UnrelEv) really quickly that I needed to fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the inner tube with care or I would be buying_(UnrelEv) another one since the air fills_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it quickly and the tube can pop_(UnrelEv) .
 Once I put_(RelNScrEv) a little air in the tube I had to listen_(ScrEv_examine_tire) as I pressed_(RelNScrEv) the air out to determine_(ScrEv_examine_tire) where the leak was_(UnrelEv) actually at .
 Once the leak location was identified_(RelNScrEv) then I was able to take_(UnrelEv) the tube home and use_(UnrelEv) the glue from the kit and apply_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the rubber patch .
 Of course I had to allow_(UnrelEv) the tube to dry_(RelNScrEv) and then deflate_(RelNScrEv) it to get_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it back on the bicycle .
 Once I got_(UnrelEv) it all put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) back together I walked_(UnrelEv) my bike back to the gas station for air .

 One time I drove_(ScrEv_ride_bike) over a piece of glass and it put_(RelNScrEv) a hole into my bicycle tire .
 I had to walk_(RelNScrEv) my bicycle all the way home , which was_(UnrelEv) very unpleasant , and then I could not use_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike again until I had fixed_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 So I looked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) online how to fix_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) punctured_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) , and went_(RelNScrEv) to the hardware store to pick_(ScrEv_get_tools) up_(ScrEv_get_tools) the necessary tools .
 After purchasing_(ScrEv_get_tools) these tools I pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) some air into the tire to locate_(RelNScrEv) the hole and then I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off of the wheel to repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 I followed_(UnrelEv) the directions on the repair kit which were_(UnrelEv) actually very simple .
 After I had patched_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole , I waited_(RelNScrEv) for the adhesive material to dry_(RelNScrEv) and then I took_(ScrEv_ride_bike) the bike out for a short test run to make_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) sure_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) that if the tire failed_(RelNScrEv) again I would not be_(UnrelEv) far from home .

 I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike around my house and noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) I had to peddle_(UnrelEv) harder than I usually do_(UnrelEv) .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off my bike to see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) if everything was_(UnrelEv) wrong .
 The front tire looked_(UnrelEv) okay , the chain was_(UnrelEv) still on the bike , but the back tire was_(UnrelEv) flat unfortunately .
 I walked_(RelNScrEv) my bike back to my house because it is_(UnrelEv) not safe to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) a bike with a flat tire .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) in my garage and looked_(RelNScrEv) for the air pump .
 I connected_(RelNScrEv) the valve of the pump to the valve on the tire .
 I pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the air pump and kept checking_(RelNScrEv) the tire to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it was working_(UnrelEv) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) hard work and it took_(UnrelEv) longer than I thought_(UnrelEv) .
 Eventually , the tire seemed_(UnrelEv) full with air .
 I put_(UnrelEv) my ear next to it to see_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) if I could hear_(UnrelEv) any air coming_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) but I did n't hear_(UnrelEv) any .
 I got_(RelNScrEv) back on my bike and it rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) fine .

 Yesterday afternoon , I decided_(UnrelEv) to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike to Central Park .
 I rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike to the park from my apartment , it took_(UnrelEv) me about 15 minutes .
 I was_(UnrelEv) very excited and happy because I have n't rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike in a very long time .
 I missed_(UnrelEv) the experience of feeling_(UnrelEv) the window blowing_(UnrelEv) against my face , and feeling_(UnrelEv) my hair float_(UnrelEv) in the air .
 When I finally got_(UnrelEv) to the park , I decided_(UnrelEv) that I would ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) around the park a few times .
 It was going to be_(UnrelEv) a great form of exercise .
 However , after I rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) the bike a few times around the park , my front bicycle tire suddenly started_(UnrelEv) to lose_(RelNScrEv) air .
 I safely got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and examined_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the tire wheel .
 I checked_(ScrEv_examine_tire) if there was_(UnrelEv) any rips or holes on the wheel .
 Perhaps I rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) over something sharp .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) a few small holes on the bike and realized_(UnrelEv) the culprit for my flat tire .
 I was forced_(UnrelEv) to carry_(RelNScrEv) the bike home in order to repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 There was_(UnrelEv) no way I would repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) at the park .
 Once I brought_(RelNScrEv) it home , I brought_(RelNScrEv) it to my basement .
 I turned_(RelNScrEv) the bike over so that it stood_(UnrelEv) on its seat and handle bars .
 I let_(RelNScrEv) the remaining_(UnrelEv) air out of the tube of my broken tire .
 Once the tire was deflated_(RelNScrEv) , I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off the rim .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) the part of the tire with the multiple holes .
 I spread_(RelNScrEv) a thin layer of glue around the holes .
 Then I looked_(RelNScrEv) around_(RelNScrEv) for my tire patch kit .
 Once I found_(RelNScrEv) it , I applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it on to the holes and covered_(RelNScrEv) over them .
 I then placed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the rim and inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it again .

 I 'd had my old bike sitting_(UnrelEv) around the house for a few months , but now that the weather is getting_(UnrelEv) warmer I decided I should probably do_(Evoking) something_(Evoking) about_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) in the front .
 I 'd already tried_(UnrelEv) using_(ScrEv_get_tools) my bike pump ; it would inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) a little but I could never get it anywhere close to fully inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) .
 I know_(UnrelEv) from past experience those fix-a-flat or emergency bike repair kits are_(UnrelEv) pretty worthless .
 I think_(UnrelEv) they 're made_(UnrelEv) for the narrow old tires you 'd see_(UnrelEv) on ten-speed street bikes .
 I have_(UnrelEv) a mountain bike with large tires and a lot of pressure is needed_(UnrelEv) to keep them inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) .
 Since I only live_(UnrelEv) a few blocks from a bicycle repair shop I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_other) the bike there .
 I bought_(UnrelEv) it at that shop anyway so I figured_(UnrelEv) they 'd do_(RelNScrEv) the service for free , as promised_(UnrelEv) .
 I stopped_(UnrelEv) by , they took_(RelNScrEv) it in the back , replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the inner tube of the tire , inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it , and it was_(UnrelEv) as good as new .
 Best of all , they only charged_(UnrelEv) me ten bucks for the tube .
 That 's_(UnrelEv) the beauty of local , independently own businesses .
 They really care_(UnrelEv) about their customers .

 I recently started_(UnrelEv) biking_(ScrEv_ride_bike) to lose_(UnrelEv) weight and for health .
 After a month of biking_(ScrEv_ride_bike) everyday , my bike hit_(ScrEv_notice_problem) a nail in the road which I think_(UnrelEv) is_(UnrelEv) pretty dangerous .
 What if a kid was playing_(UnrelEv) ?
 I was pretty devastated_(UnrelEv) .
 Because of the expenses with school , I would not be_(UnrelEv) able to afford_(RelNScrEv) a new tire .
 So I thought_(UnrelEv) to myself , maybe I can fix_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 I resolved_(UnrelEv) to fix_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) this Sunday , because I figured_(UnrelEv) Friday and Saturday would be_(UnrelEv) too busy .
 I 've never repaired_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) before .
 So I searched_(RelNScrEv) google for some tutorials .
 Turns_(UnrelEv) out , I can just use_(RelNScrEv) a sticky material to cover_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the part that 's broken_(RelNScrEv) .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) at various online store .
 No one seemed_(UnrelEv) to have_(RelNScrEv) it .
 Just my luck .
 Then it occurred_(UnrelEv) to me that maybe an automotive store would have_(RelNScrEv) it , and they did_(UnrelEv) !
 It was_(UnrelEv) only $ 5 .
 Stuck_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it in and inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) my tire .
 It 's been working_(UnrelEv) for months ever since !

 Today I found_(ScrEv_notice_problem) out my bike tire was_(RelNScrEv) flat right before I needed to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) it to work .
 I hurriedly flipped_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) the bike upside down and sat_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) it on the seat .
 I pulled_(ScrEv_loose_nut) quick release bolt on the tire and unscrewed_(ScrEv_loose_nut) it .
 I disconnected_(ScrEv_other) the brakes and removed_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the wheel from the bike .
 I then used_(UnrelEv) the tire removal tool so that I could get_(RelNScrEv) to the inner tube .
 I removed_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the inner tube , and examined_(UnrelEv) where the hole might be_(UnrelEv) .
 I could not find_(UnrelEv) the hole so I put_(ScrEv_other) it into the sink with water .
 I found_(ScrEv_other) the tiny hole in the tube .
 I used_(UnrelEv) glue and a chunk of rubber from an old inner tube to fix_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the puncture .
 I had to let_(UnrelEv) it dry_(RelNScrEv) for a few minutes .
 I put_(ScrEv_other) the inner tube back onto the rim , and then put_(ScrEv_other) the tire back onto the rim .
 I fit_(ScrEv_other) the tire back onto the bike and screwed_(ScrEv_other) the tire on and rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) to work .

 When you have_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) the first thing you need to do_(UnrelEv) is_(UnrelEv) see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) where the hole is originating_(RelNScrEv) from .
 You have to fully unscrew_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the tire first and take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the outer rubber .
 Then you have to take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the inner rubber tube off of the tire frame .
 Once you have_(UnrelEv) the inner tube try_(UnrelEv) to find_(ScrEv_get_tools) a body of water .
 Most easy method is_(UnrelEv) filling_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire back up with air and listening_(ScrEv_examine_tire) for the sound .
 Another method is_(UnrelEv) filling_(RelNScrEv) a bucket with water if you are_(UnrelEv) at home .
 Once the inner tube is submerged_(RelNScrEv) in the water you should be_(UnrelEv) able to see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) bubbles coming_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) of the hole .
 Once you identify_(ScrEv_examine_tire) where the puncture is_(UnrelEv) you have to dry_(RelNScrEv) the area first before using_(RelNScrEv) either a specific tape or glue to plug_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole .
 Verify_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) once you repaired_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) hole_(Evoking) place_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tube back on the frame and fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it back up with air .

 This weekend , I planned_(UnrelEv) to go bike riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) .
 I had n't gone_(ScrEv_ride_bike) in some time and , when I checked_(ScrEv_other) my bike beforehand , discovered_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that one of the tires had gone_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 I attempted_(UnrelEv) to pump_(ScrEv_other) air back into the tire , first .
 The tire would not hold_(RelNScrEv) air , so I knew_(UnrelEv) that I would have to repair_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) the bike upside down .
 This would help_(UnrelEv) me by giving_(UnrelEv) me better access to the bike tires .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) a wrench of appropriate size and used_(RelNScrEv) it to take_(ScrEv_other) off the bolts that held the tire on the bike .
 When I had taken_(ScrEv_other) off the bolts , I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off the bike frame .
 Then , I let_(ScrEv_other) out the rest of the air out of the bike tire .
 When the tire was_(UnrelEv) completely flat , I carefully took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the rubber tire off the metal bike spoke frame .
 The inside of a bike tire is_(UnrelEv) hollow and houses_(UnrelEv) the tire tube .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that the bike tire was_(UnrelEv) probably flat because of a puncture in the bike tube , so I checked_(RelNScrEv) that first .
 Sure enough , there was_(UnrelEv) a large hole in my bike tire tube .
 This tube would not hold_(RelNScrEv) air .
 I had_(UnrelEv) a small bike tire repair kit in my garage and went to get_(ScrEv_get_tools) it .
 I returned_(UnrelEv) with it and took_(ScrEv_get_tools) out the rubber patch that I would use_(UnrelEv) to repair_(Evoking) the tube .
 I prepared_(ScrEv_other) the tube and then applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a rubber patch to the puncture with a bit of glue .
 I then tested_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) the bike tire tube and found_(UnrelEv) that the patch was working_(UnrelEv) .
 So , I replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tube and the outer tire on the metal spokes .
 Then , I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the bike frame and tightened_(ScrEv_other) the bolts that would hold_(RelNScrEv) it there .
 Finally , I put_(ScrEv_other) the bike right-side up and filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with air .
 I knew this weekend would be_(UnrelEv) fun .

 I was about to ride_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) to the park one day when I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that the front tire was_(ScrEv_notice_problem) flat .
 I realized_(UnrelEv) I would have to repair_(Evoking) it .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) into my garage to get_(ScrEv_get_tools) some tools .
 The first thing I did was remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire by unscrewing_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the screws that were holding_(RelNScrEv) the wheel in place .
 Once that was done_(UnrelEv) , I examined_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the wheel to see_(ScrEv_examine_tire) what the damage was_(RelNScrEv) .
 It turns_(UnrelEv) out a nail must have punctured_(ScrEv_other) the tire .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) some glue and proceeded_(UnrelEv) to glue_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a tube patch over the tiny hole .
 I continued_(UnrelEv) to apply_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) pressure to the tube patch .
 When that was done_(UnrelEv) , I inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire back to fullness .
 As I was inflating_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire , I made_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) sure the patch stayed_(RelNScrEv) in place .
 I then reattached_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the wheel back on the bicycle and it was_(UnrelEv) good to go_(UnrelEv) .

 When riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) bikes , sometimes the tires will go_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) .
 This can happen_(UnrelEv) either because you ran_(RelNScrEv) over something and there is_(UnrelEv) a hole , or because the tire is leaking_(RelNScrEv) air somewhere .
 Sometimes you can just get_(ScrEv_get_tools) a pump and refill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with air , and sometimes you need to replace_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) entire_(Evoking) thing_(Evoking) .
 There is_(UnrelEv) this stuff that I have used_(UnrelEv) before that worked_(RelNScrEv) for small holes though , it was_(UnrelEv) like this foam stuff that is_(UnrelEv) in a bottle .
 You just spray_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it in and let_(UnrelEv) it sit_(RelNScrEv) for a little bit .
 the foam closes_(RelNScrEv) the hole up and you can refill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire and everything works_(RelNScrEv) again if the hole was_(UnrelEv) n't a bad one .
 If the tire is too far gone_(RelNScrEv) , you wo n't be_(UnrelEv) able to repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) with anything and will end_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) replacing_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) whole_(Evoking) thing_(Evoking) or risk_(UnrelEv) riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on the metal rims which can seriously damage_(UnrelEv) your bike .

 Once I had that accomplished_(UnrelEv) I had to remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the wheel from the bike .
 This took_(UnrelEv) a little bit and I needed_(ScrEv_get_tools) some tools to finish_(UnrelEv) this task .

 Then all of a sudden the mood was dampened_(UnrelEv) and corrupted_(UnrelEv) by that horrible noise of leaking_(ScrEv_notice_problem) air .
 I had hit_(RelNScrEv) some road debree that caused_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 After cursing_(RelNScrEv) the event and going_(RelNScrEv) through a small tantrum I consulted_(ScrEv_get_tools) the tools of my backpack which I always brought_(ScrEv_get_tools) with me .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off , removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tube , isolated_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the puncture , and then applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the patch .
 I reassembled_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tube and tire , pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it up with my small hand pump , and made_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my way back home .

 I was_(Evoking) riding_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) yesterday and somehow I must have run_(RelNScrEv) over something and punctured_(RelNScrEv) the front tire of my bike .
 I measured_(RelNScrEv) my tire height and wrote_(RelNScrEv) down my model of my bike before I wen_(ScrEv_other) to the bike shop to buy_(ScrEv_get_tire) a new inner tube .
 I go_(ScrEv_other) to the bike shop and the man behind the counter asked_(RelNScrEv) what I needed_(UnrelEv) help with .
 I explained_(RelNScrEv) I needed_(UnrelEv) a new inner tube for my bike since I had gotten_(RelNScrEv) a flat tire .
 I showed_(RelNScrEv) him the model number and the tire height an d he quickly went_(UnrelEv) a got_(RelNScrEv) the inner tube I needed_(UnrelEv) .
 I payed_(RelNScrEv) for my purchase , thank_(UnrelEv) the man and went_(UnrelEv) home to fix_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) .
 I took_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the front tire off and gently pried_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the outer tire off .
 The inner tube is_(UnrelEv) sort of pliable so I stretched_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) it over and off of the rim .
 I took_(UnrelEv) the new inner tube and stretched_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it on the metal rim , making_(UnrelEv) sure the stem when you inflate_(RelNScrEv) the tire was lined_(UnrelEv) up with the hole on the metal rim .
 I replaced_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the outer tire and re-inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with my bicycle pump .
 Now I can ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike again !

 I must have struck_(RelNScrEv) something while riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike because it suddenly lost_(RelNScrEv) all its pressure .
 Upon closer examination , I found_(ScrEv_notice_problem) a screw in it .
 I sighed_(UnrelEv) with frustration and laid_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) the bike on its side .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) a wrench , a tube , and a tire tool out of my bag .
 I loosened_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the nut holding_(UnrelEv) the wheel on my bike with the wrench and then undid_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the rest with my hands .
 When the wheel was_(UnrelEv) free , I took_(RelNScrEv) the tire tool and wedged_(RelNScrEv) it between the wheel and tire to remove_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the rubber .
 I examined_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the inner tube and it was_(UnrelEv) definitely beyond repair .
 I removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the damaged tube and replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it with the new one .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back onto the wheel and pulled_(ScrEv_pull_air_pin) the air pin through the hole on the wheel .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) my air pump and began_(UnrelEv) to refill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with air .

 Last week , I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bicycle on a dirt path through the forest .
 The path had_(UnrelEv) many rocks and branches on it and at some point during my ride , I hit_(RelNScrEv) a rock and put_(RelNScrEv) a hole in the tire .
 I was forced_(UnrelEv) to walk_(RelNScrEv) my bike back to my house and inspect_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the tires .
 It seemed_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) a minor hole where the rock had pierced_(RelNScrEv) the tire that would require_(UnrelEv) some minor patching_(RelNScrEv) .
 I loaded_(ScrEv_other) the bicycle into the back of the car and drove_(ScrEv_other) it to our local bike shop where they applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) some sort of fill to the hole and patched_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it up .
 Once completed_(UnrelEv) , my tires retained_(UnrelEv) their air pressure and were_(UnrelEv) good as new .
 I paid_(RelNScrEv) the man at the shop and took_(RelNScrEv) my bike home .
 The next day , I took_(UnrelEv) it back out for a ride and all was_(UnrelEv) well !
 The bike shop was_(UnrelEv) far better equipped_(RelNScrEv) to fix_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) than I was_(UnrelEv) .

 Yesterday , I woke_(UnrelEv) up and realized_(UnrelEv) how gorgeous of a day it was so I decided_(UnrelEv) to eat_(UnrelEv) my breakfast and then go_(UnrelEv) outside for a nice bike ride with some friends at the park .
 When I went_(UnrelEv) into the garage to grab_(UnrelEv) my bicycle I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that the tire had gone_(UnrelEv) flat and I would need to repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) if I wanted to go_(ScrEv_ride_bike) for a ride with my friends .
 I called_(UnrelEv) my friend Joey up and asked_(UnrelEv) if he could give_(UnrelEv) me a half hour to replace_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 Joey said_(UnrelEv) that was_(UnrelEv) fine so I went_(UnrelEv) and got_(ScrEv_get_tools) some tools and a spare tire to replace_(RelNScrEv) the flat one with .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the old tire off and tightly put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the new one on .
 To make_(UnrelEv) sure that everything was_(UnrelEv) in place I took_(ScrEv_ride_bike) it for a test ride around the block before calling_(UnrelEv) my friend Joey back and letting_(UnrelEv) him know_(UnrelEv) that I was_(UnrelEv) now ready for a ride .
 After that I went_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on the bike ride and everything went_(UnrelEv) perfectly .

 I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my new bicycle when I stumbled_(UnrelEv) over a rock or something .
 The tire seemed_(UnrelEv) to explode_(RelNScrEv) upon impact .
 I struggled_(UnrelEv) to stay_(UnrelEv) atop the bicycle but was fortunately able to keep_(UnrelEv) my balance .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that I had to fix_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) in order to use_(RelNScrEv) the bike .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) the local gas station was_(UnrelEv) only a few blocks away so I decided_(UnrelEv) to walk_(ScrEv_other) my bike there .
 The first thing I did_(UnrelEv) was get_(ScrEv_get_tools) something to tape_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up the hole .
 The manager gave_(RelNScrEv) me some sort of sticky resin in order to patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) things up .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to the air pump to put_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) some air into the tire and once it was_(UnrelEv) full I was_(UnrelEv) ready to patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it up .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) the resin to cover_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole and the tire seemed_(UnrelEv) as good as new .
 I rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) the bike home and made_(UnrelEv) sure to avoid_(UnrelEv) rolling_(UnrelEv) over anymore rocks .

 When I was_(UnrelEv) younger , I would occasionally get_(Evoking) flats_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) tires_(Evoking) .
 Whenever it happened_(UnrelEv) I would repair_(Evoking) it as soon as I had_(UnrelEv) the opportunity .
 In my garage I generally used_(UnrelEv) a piece from an old inner tube and glue to patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole .
 Before I patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it however , I would remove_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the wheel from the bike frame using_(UnrelEv) a socket wrench to remove_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the nuts that secure_(RelNScrEv) the tire to the frame .
 Then I would remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the inner tube from the outer tire .
 Then I would put_(ScrEv_other) the tube in a pan of water and look_(UnrelEv) for bubbles and where they may be coming_(UnrelEv) from ; the bubbles will lead_(UnrelEv) me to the where the flat or flats are_(UnrelEv) .
 I would then mark_(ScrEv_other) them with a marker or piece of tape , then cut_(ScrEv_other) a big enough section from the old inner tube I had in my garage and patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) with the proper super glue and let_(UnrelEv) it sit_(RelNScrEv) for at least an hour to properly harden_(ScrEv_other) .
 Then I would put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the repaired inner tube back into the tire , put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back onto the bike , and then fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire with air .

 Last weekend I took_(ScrEv_ride_bike) a bike ride around my neighborhood .
 When I got_(UnrelEv) back home , I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that my front tire looked_(UnrelEv) low .
 I looked_(ScrEv_examine_tire) at the tire and realized_(UnrelEv) there was_(UnrelEv) a nail stuck_(RelNScrEv) in it .
 I took_(RelNScrEv) the nail out .
 Then removed_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire from the bike .
 Inside the tire was_(UnrelEv) a bike tube .
 The air goes_(UnrelEv) in the bike tube , but it was leaking_(RelNScrEv) because of the hole the nail put_(RelNScrEv) in it .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) my patch kit , and glued_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a bike tube patch over the hole .
 Then I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my air pump .
 I pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) and pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) until the tube was inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) .
 Afterwards , I put_(RelNScrEv) the bike tube in water to see_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) if there were_(UnrelEv) any air bubbles .
 Air bubbles in the water mean_(UnrelEv) there 's_(UnrelEv) still a leak .
 Luckily for me , it was no longer leaking_(RelNScrEv) air !
 I put_(ScrEv_other) the tire back over the top of the bike tube and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on my bicycle .
 I looked_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) at it carefully , then hopped_(UnrelEv) on for another ride around the neighborhood , this time avoiding_(UnrelEv) any nails .

 I ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike to work everyday .
 I also ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) for pleasure on the weekends .
 This morning I was pedaling_(ScrEv_ride_bike) along and all of the sudden I could feel_(ScrEv_notice_problem) the gritty pavement scraping_(UnrelEv) the rim .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off the bike and sure enough the front tire was_(UnrelEv) flat .
 Well that is_(UnrelEv) bad but not as bad if the rear tire was_(UnrelEv) flat and I had to take_(ScrEv_other) the chain off .
 I always carry_(UnrelEv) a spare inner tube and have_(UnrelEv) a pump on the frame of my bike .
 This was going to be_(UnrelEv) easy as I have done_(UnrelEv) this many times before .
 I loosened_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the lock nuts that hold_(UnrelEv) the front tire in place and pulled_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire from the frame .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) in my bike pack and found_(RelNScrEv) the tool that helps_(UnrelEv) take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off the rim .
 This took_(UnrelEv) all of 5 minutes .
 When I had_(UnrelEv) that off I took_(UnrelEv) the old inner tube and placed_(UnrelEv) it in my backpack to patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) later .
 I then fit_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the good inner tube inside the tire and in reverse order fitted_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire to the rim .
 I next took_(ScrEv_get_tools) my pump and filled_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it up to the correct pressure .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the front fork and tightened_(RelNScrEv) the locking_(UnrelEv) nuts and was_(UnrelEv) on my way .
 I was_(UnrelEv) n't even late for work .

 The Flat Tire It was_(UnrelEv) a beautiful sunny day with only a slight breeze .
 It seemed_(UnrelEv) to me like a perfect day for a bicycle ride .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) I would ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on the bike trails to the park and enjoy_(UnrelEv) my day .
 However , when I went_(UnrelEv) out into the garage , I saw_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that the back tire on my bicycle was_(UnrelEv) flat .
 Luckily , I had_(UnrelEv) a spare tire on hand .
 The tire that was_(UnrelEv) flat had been_(UnrelEv) on my bicycle for a couple of years now , it needed replaced_(ScrEv_remove_tire) anyway .
 I remembered_(UnrelEv) how my dad had taught_(UnrelEv) me to replace_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire and got_(UnrelEv) the job done_(UnrelEv) .
 It did not take_(RelNScrEv) as long as I thought_(UnrelEv) it might_(UnrelEv) .
 I kept_(RelNScrEv) the old tire to see_(UnrelEv) if I could patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it up later and put_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air in it to have_(UnrelEv) on hand as a spare when I needed_(UnrelEv) one .

 Last week when I went biking_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on a trail with a friend , she rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) over a nail and one of her bike tires was_(UnrelEv) punctured_(RelNScrEv) .
 We immediately stopped_(ScrEv_get_off) riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) so that we could fix_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) problem_(Evoking) , and we were_(UnrelEv) lucky that it was_(UnrelEv) n't too bad of an issue .
 To fix_(Evoking) it , we had to return_(ScrEv_other) home and take_(RelNScrEv) care of it with the tools we had_(RelNScrEv) there .
 We turned_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) the bike over so it was resting_(RelNScrEv) on the handlebars and the seat so that we would have_(UnrelEv) access to the wheel very easily .
 Upon spinning_(ScrEv_other) the wheel , we found_(RelNScrEv) the nail she had run_(RelNScrEv) over and removed_(ScrEv_other) it .
 We had to release_(ScrEv_other) all the air from the tube to begin_(UnrelEv) with , then take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off of the rim using_(RelNScrEv) tools called_(UnrelEv) a tire levers .
 After we had_(UnrelEv) that off , we had to remove_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tube from the tire and inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it with enough air to find_(RelNScrEv) the hole .
 We knew_(UnrelEv) about where it would be_(UnrelEv) .
 Using_(RelNScrEv) a piece of my brother 's chalk , we marked_(ScrEv_other) where the hole was_(UnrelEv) so we would n't lose_(UnrelEv) the spot , and then we took_(ScrEv_other) the air out of the tube again .
 Using_(RelNScrEv) a patch kit designed_(UnrelEv) for this kind of issue , we patched_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up the hole and put_(ScrEv_other) the tube back into the tire .
 We put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the wheel and re-inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it .
 The patch worked_(UnrelEv) perfectly and we were able to go_(UnrelEv) out biking_(ScrEv_ride_bike) again the next day !

 Carrying_(UnrelEv) a spare inner tube saves_(UnrelEv) lots of time and trouble , since I have to carry_(UnrelEv) a patch kit anyway .
 However , if I do n't have_(UnrelEv) one , I can still fix_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) .
 First I turn_(RelNScrEv) the bike over , and remove_(RelNScrEv) the brake by opening_(RelNScrEv) the quick release lever .
 Then I remove_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire with its quick release lever .
 Now I inspect_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the outside of the tire , to try_(UnrelEv) to find_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the source of the problem .
 I look_(ScrEv_examine_tire) for imbedded glass , thorns , cuts or tears .
 If I find_(RelNScrEv) a foreign object , I remove_(RelNScrEv) it .
 Then I take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off .
 I deflate_(RelNScrEv) it , and push_(RelNScrEv) the side of the tire towards the middle , trying_(UnrelEv) to expose_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tube .
 If that fails_(UnrelEv) , I use_(UnrelEv) tire irons , if I have_(UnrelEv) them .
 I shove_(RelNScrEv) one in on the opposite side of the wheel form the valve , and lever_(RelNScrEv) the edge of the tire out of the rim .
 Then I put_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) the next tire iron about three spokes away and try_(UnrelEv) to lift_(RelNScrEv) the section of tire in between up and away from the rim .
 This makes_(UnrelEv) it possible to take_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the whole tire out and remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) it .
 I look_(ScrEv_examine_tire) for the leak inside the tire , and then on the tube .
 I deflate_(RelNScrEv) the tube by pushing_(RelNScrEv) the valve center until I hear_(UnrelEv) air hiss_(UnrelEv) .
 If I can not find_(RelNScrEv) the leak , I put_(RelNScrEv) the tube in a bucket of water and look_(ScrEv_examine_tire) for bubbles .
 If I can not do_(UnrelEv) that , I listen_(RelNScrEv) , and then I look_(ScrEv_examine_tire) around the valve .
 I also inspect_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the inside of the tire .
 Now , I need_(UnrelEv) a patch kit .
 I clean_(RelNScrEv) the outside of the tire near the leak as much as I can_(UnrelEv) .
 Then I roughen_(RelNScrEv) the area with the scratchy thing provided_(UnrelEv) .
 I spread_(RelNScrEv) the foul-smelling_(UnrelEv) glue , let_(UnrelEv) it dry_(RelNScrEv) until it is_(UnrelEv) tacky , and press_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) on_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the patch , starting_(UnrelEv) at its center , and being_(UnrelEv) careful not to glue_(UnrelEv) the tire to itself .
 Now I partially re-inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tube , and replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it in the tire , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the spoke cushion stays_(UnrelEv) in place .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire on the wheel , and check_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) to see_(UnrelEv) that the valve is pointed_(UnrelEv) straight to the center .
 I re-inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tube , and then replace_(ScrEv_other) the wheel and reattach_(RelNScrEv) it and reattach_(RelNScrEv) the brake .
 And I turn_(RelNScrEv) the bike over again and ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) .

 Yesterday while I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike I got_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 Luckily I had_(ScrEv_get_tools) a tire repair kit in the garage .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) very easy to do_(UnrelEv) .
 The first thing I did_(UnrelEv) was use_(RelNScrEv) a flathead screwdriver to pop_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off of the rim .
 The tire is_(UnrelEv) hollow inside , with no tube .
 The patch kit contains_(RelNScrEv) small rubber patches with glue , that you use_(RelNScrEv) to seal_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) any holes that might appear_(RelNScrEv) .
 When I had_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off the rim I looked_(ScrEv_examine_tire) all around inside to find_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the hole .
 When I found_(ScrEv_examine_tire) it , I used_(RelNScrEv) a special piece of sandpaper inside the repair kit to clean_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) the area around the hole , so the glue would stick_(RelNScrEv) nicely .
 I then applied_(RelNScrEv) the glue and put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) one of the small rubber patches onto it .
 The instructions said_(UnrelEv) to let_(UnrelEv) it dry_(RelNScrEv) for a few hours , so I went_(UnrelEv) inside and watched_(UnrelEv) TV .
 After awhile I came_(UnrelEv) back out and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back on the rim , then used_(RelNScrEv) a pump to pump_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire full of air .
 Sure enough , it fixed_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) hole_(Evoking) !

 Today , I went_(RelNScrEv) to the store to buy_(ScrEv_get_tools) a flat tire repair kit .
 I took_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire off the bike and located_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the nail so I could remove_(RelNScrEv) it .

 I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my flat head screwdriver and was_(UnrelEv) able to separate_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the rim from the tire and inner tube .
 I pumped_(ScrEv_examine_tire) just enough air to find_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the leak in my tire where the nail had penetrated_(RelNScrEv) .
 After finding_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the hole , I buffed_(RelNScrEv) the area the hole was_(UnrelEv) at and applied_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) glue to it .
 Then I put_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a tire patch over the glue and let_(UnrelEv) it sit_(RelNScrEv) for a few minutes .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the inner tube and tire back on the rim , and pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) my tire up with air .

 I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the old , flat tire off of the bicycle using_(ScrEv_get_tools) my wrench to loosen_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the screws and other mechanical devices .
 I then stretched_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the new tire out over the wheel and affixed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it .
 I twirled_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) it around and tested_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) it to make_(UnrelEv) sure that it was properly fastened_(ScrEv_other) .
 Next , I drove_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) around the driveway to make_(UnrelEv) sure that it would hold_(RelNScrEv) .
 Sure enough , it was_(UnrelEv) secure and ready for me to go_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) ride_(Evoking) .

 Last week on a bike_(ScrEv_ride_bike) ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) to my friends house , I was traveling_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on a very rough road with a lot of rocks on the side of it .
 I realized_(ScrEv_notice_problem) after about 10 minutes into my ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) that I had_(UnrelEv) a very bad flat tire .
 Thankfully I carry_(UnrelEv) the proper tools and items with me to fix_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 I pulled_(RelNScrEv) off the road and opened_(RelNScrEv) my bag with my tools .
 After removing_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire and the tube inside , I used_(UnrelEv) my tools to put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) a brand new tube inside of the tire .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) it to make_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) sure_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) that I had aligned_(UnrelEv) everything correctly and after ensuring_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) that I did_(UnrelEv) , I placed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back onto the bike .
 I then used_(UnrelEv) my portable pump to make_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) sure_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) that I had_(UnrelEv) the proper amount of air pressure inside of it , because I did n't want_(UnrelEv) another flat .
 After checking_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) everything twice , I was_(UnrelEv) on my way again .
 It was_(UnrelEv) an easy fix .

 While I was_(UnrelEv) out riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike one warm spring day , one of the tires went_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 Fortunately I had_(UnrelEv) a repair kit with me in a pouch on the bike .
 I always kept_(UnrelEv) it with me on rides_(ScrEv_ride_bike) just in case of such an occurrence .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and went_(RelNScrEv) to the side of the trail out of the way of other bikers and runners .
 I lay_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) the bike on its side and got_(ScrEv_get_tools) the repair kit out of the pouch .
 The repair kit contained_(UnrelEv) a new inner tube which I inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) .
 I then pulled_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the outer tire off of the inner tube .
 I replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the flattened_(RelNScrEv) inner tube with the new one and replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the outer tire over it .
 I rode_(ScrEv_ride_bike) off_(ScrEv_ride_bike) slowly to make_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) sure_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) everything was_(UnrelEv) correctly in place .
 Once I got_(UnrelEv) home , I replaced_(UnrelEv) the spare tire kit with a new one so that I would be_(UnrelEv) prepared on my next ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) .

 I went_(UnrelEv) out to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bicycle one morning , only to find_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that my front tire was_(UnrelEv) very flat .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_tools) my manual air pump and tried_(UnrelEv) to put_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into it , but it would not hold_(UnrelEv) any and kept_(UnrelEv) going_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 I heard_(UnrelEv) a hissing_(UnrelEv) sound , so I knew_(UnrelEv) I had punctured_(RelNScrEv) the tire somehow .
 Luckily I had_(UnrelEv) a spare inner tube that I could put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) on_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) .
 I flipped_(RelNScrEv) my bicycle over and took_(ScrEv_get_tools) a wrench to remove_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire from the spokes .
 It was_(UnrelEv) kind of greasy and messy , but I did n't mind_(UnrelEv) .
 I was able to get_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) it off pretty easily .
 I then pushed_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the tire off of the rim all the way around .
 When the tire was_(UnrelEv) off the rim , I took_(RelNScrEv) the spare tube I had_(UnrelEv) and put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it all around the inside of the tire .
 I then pushed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire back onto the rim .
 It did not go_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) as easily as it came_(UnrelEv) off_(UnrelEv) , and it took_(UnrelEv) a bit of struggling_(UnrelEv) with the tire to get_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it back on .
 Finally I had_(UnrelEv) it on .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) my manual air pump and pumped_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) up the tube inside of the tire .
 It held_(UnrelEv) air very nicely , and I did n't hear_(UnrelEv) any hissing_(UnrelEv) and it did not go_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 I then put_(ScrEv_other) the tire back on the front bicycle fork , and tightened_(ScrEv_other) the nuts so it would hold_(UnrelEv) very well and not slip_(UnrelEv) or come_(UnrelEv) off_(UnrelEv) .
 I then flipped_(RelNScrEv) my bicycle over and made_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) sure_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) the tire was still holding_(UnrelEv) air .
 It was_(UnrelEv) , so I put_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) my helmet , and finally was able to enjoy_(UnrelEv) my morning bike_(ScrEv_ride_bike) ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) .

 Last summer , I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike and I must have ran_(UnrelEv) over something sharp because my tire started_(UnrelEv) going_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 I tried_(UnrelEv) to use_(UnrelEv) a repair kit , but the hole was_(UnrelEv) too big and the patch would not stay_(RelNScrEv) on the old tube .
 It turns_(UnrelEv) out that I ran_(UnrelEv) over a screw and it had been lodged_(RelNScrEv) through the tire and into the tube .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that I had_(UnrelEv) a twenty six inch wheel , so I went_(ScrEv_other) up to the local hardware store .
 They had_(UnrelEv) a new tube and I bought_(ScrEv_get_tire) a new tire , just in case there were_(UnrelEv) any other problems .
 I followed_(UnrelEv) the instructions and I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the old tire off .
 The somehow got_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the new tube and tire onto the wheel , but it was_(UnrelEv) kind of a pain to do_(UnrelEv) .
 I finally got_(UnrelEv) it on and all that I had to do_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) put_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) in some air .
 I plugged_(ScrEv_other) in my air compressor but it would not turn_(UnrelEv) on for some reason .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) an old tire pump buried_(UnrelEv) in my garage and I was_(UnrelEv) finally able to put_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air into the tires .
 In the future , I am going to be_(UnrelEv) more careful to avoid_(UnrelEv) sharp exits because repairing_(Evoking) the flat tire was_(UnrelEv) a pain .

 I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bicycle down a beautiful country road on a sunny , summer day .
 When all of a sudden , I felt_(ScrEv_notice_problem) something was_(UnrelEv) wrong .
 I stopped_(ScrEv_get_off) my bike , got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and looked_(RelNScrEv) down .
 My front tire had gone_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 I must have ridden_(ScrEv_ride_bike) over something sharp to puncture_(RelNScrEv) it .
 So I pulled_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) my gear bag that I had strapped_(RelNScrEv) to my bike .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_tire) an extra rubber tire liner and the tools needed_(UnrelEv) to repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 I took_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the wheel off my bike so it would be_(UnrelEv) easier to work_(RelNScrEv) on .
 I removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the punctured_(RelNScrEv) rubber tire liner from the wheel .
 I replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it with the new one using_(RelNScrEv) my tools .
 I then used_(RelNScrEv) a special little cartridge I had brought_(ScrEv_get_tools) with me that was filled_(UnrelEv) with pressurized_(UnrelEv) carbon dioxide to pump_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) my new tire up .
 Once it was done_(UnrelEv) , I placed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) it back on my bike and continued_(ScrEv_ride_bike) on_(ScrEv_ride_bike) with my ride .

 In a couple days , me and some friends were going to celebrate_(UnrelEv) the good weather by going_(UnrelEv) biking_(ScrEv_ride_bike) .
 I had_(UnrelEv) my bike sit_(UnrelEv) in my garage for a couple years not using_(UnrelEv) it .
 So when I decided_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) it out , to my surprise it had_(UnrelEv) flat tires .
 I struggled_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) the bike out of the garage with all the other junk in it , and found_(RelNScrEv) my tire pump along with it .
 After I got_(UnrelEv) my bike out , I kneeled_(UnrelEv) near the bike and found_(RelNScrEv) cap for the tire .
 I unscrewed_(ScrEv_pull_air_pin) it with a pair of pliers because it was_(UnrelEv) on tight .
 I plugged_(RelNScrEv) the hose into the tire and started_(UnrelEv) pumping_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) until it was_(UnrelEv) at a good level .
 I quickly unplugged_(RelNScrEv) the air pump and screwed_(RelNScrEv) the cap back on .
 After this I moved_(UnrelEv) over to the rear tire , and repeated_(UnrelEv) the same process to fix_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .

 If you have_(UnrelEv) a flat tire it is_(UnrelEv) quite easy to change_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) yourself .
 The front tire is_(UnrelEv) the easiest to change_(Unclear) while the back will require_(UnrelEv) more time and maybe additional tools .
 This is_(UnrelEv) usually the back tire is_(UnrelEv) where the chain and gears are connected_(UnrelEv) to so it is harder to take_(ScrEv_free_wheel) off_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the bike frame .
 Sadly , most of the time a flat tire is_(UnrelEv) the back tire because the back tire supports_(UnrelEv) most of your weight on a bicycle .
 So you 'll need_(UnrelEv) a wrench to undo_(ScrEv_loose_nut) the bolts on both sides of the tire .
 This will allow_(UnrelEv) you to take_(ScrEv_free_wheel) off_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the entire tire .
 Inside the tire is_(UnrelEv) an innertube , and this is_(UnrelEv) the part you either need to replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) or patch_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) up_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) .
 If it is_(UnrelEv) a small hole and you can easily find_(RelNScrEv) the hole , you can use_(UnrelEv) a tire patch kit to fix_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) the hole .
 Other wise you may_(UnrelEv) just replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the entire innertube altogether .
 Either way you will put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the innertube back , and then the tire back onto the bike frame .
 Lastly , screw_(RelNScrEv) back on the bolts and pump_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) some air into the tire .
 You 'll be_(UnrelEv) ready to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) soon after !

 One day when I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bicycle , and I realized_(ScrEv_notice_problem) my back tire was getting_(RelNScrEv) low .
 I walked_(ScrEv_other) the bicycle back home and pulled_(ScrEv_get_tools) out my patch kit .
 After removing_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) my back tire from the bicycle I let_(ScrEv_other) the remaining air out from the valve , and used_(UnrelEv) the small tool on the edge of the tire , to lift_(RelNScrEv) the tire away and clicked_(ScrEv_other) the tool onto one of the spokes .
 Using_(UnrelEv) more of the tools , I continued_(UnrelEv) to lift_(RelNScrEv) the tire away from the rim until I could easily remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the rest of the tire with my fingers .
 By this time , the inner tube was exposed_(UnrelEv) , and pushing_(RelNScrEv) the valve through , I removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tube completely from the tire .
 I put_(ScrEv_other) the tube into a bucket of water , and used_(UnrelEv) the air pump to pump_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) air back into the tube , and watched_(UnrelEv) for bubbles to see_(UnrelEv) where the hole was_(UnrelEv) .
 I kept_(UnrelEv) a close eye on where the hole was_(UnrelEv) , and taking_(ScrEv_other) the tube out of the bucket , I dried_(ScrEv_other) the tube with a towel .
 I used_(UnrelEv) the small sandpaper from the kit , and carefully roughed_(ScrEv_other) the area around the hole .
 I then chose_(ScrEv_other) a patch .
 A round one for a puncture , or the rectangle for a slice .
 I placed_(ScrEv_other) glue on the patch , and firmly placed_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it on the tube .
 I was_(UnrelEv) very careful , because last time I got_(UnrelEv) glue on my fingers , and my fingers felt_(UnrelEv) funny for days !
 I went_(UnrelEv) for some lemonade while I waited_(UnrelEv) for the patch to dry_(ScrEv_other) .
 Boy , that lemonade was_(UnrelEv) good on such a hot day .
 I tried_(UnrelEv) pumping_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) some air back in the tube , and carefully watched_(UnrelEv) around the patch , to make_(UnrelEv) sure no air was leaking_(RelNScrEv) .
 I was_(UnrelEv) in luck , the patch was_(UnrelEv) good .
 I carefully replaced_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tube into the tire , and used_(UnrelEv) the_(UnrelEv) small tools to replace_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tire into the rim and used_(UnrelEv) the air pump to fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it back up .
 Now I was_(UnrelEv) ready for more adventures !

 In order for a bike to be_(UnrelEv) rideable , its tires must be_(UnrelEv) full of air .
 If you ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) over a sharp thorn or rock , you might get_(UnrelEv) unlucky , and pierce_(RelNScrEv) one of your tires .
 The air will rush_(RelNScrEv) out of the hole , and you will have_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) , often just called_(UnrelEv) , a flat .
 If this happens_(UnrelEv) , you mus n't continue_(UnrelEv) to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) ; you need to stop_(ScrEv_get_off) somewhere , and repair_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 First , you 'll need to remove_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the wheel that has_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .
 It is_(UnrelEv) usually easier to remove_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the front wheel than the back , because of the gears in back .
 Once you have_(ScrEv_free_wheel) the damaged_(RelNScrEv) wheel off the bike , you need to remove_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tough outer part of the tire by prying_(ScrEv_remove_tire) it , little by little , off of the rim of the wheel .
 The hole in the tough tire is_(UnrelEv) not actually the problem ; it 's_(UnrelEv) the hole in the inner tube that must be repaired_(Evoking) .
 Once you 've pried_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire off the rim , it is_(UnrelEv) easy to pull_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) out_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the floppy tube .
 Now you have to locate_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the hole .
 Sometimes the hole is_(UnrelEv) very obvious , just by looking_(ScrEv_examine_tire) .
 Other times , you can submerge_(RelNScrEv) the tube under water , and look_(ScrEv_examine_tire) for_(ScrEv_examine_tire) bubbles .
 Once found_(ScrEv_examine_tire) , the hole can be easily patched_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) using_(RelNScrEv) a patch kit .
 Test_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the hole is totally sealed_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) before reassembling_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the wheel !
 If the repaired_(Evoking) tube holds_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) air well , you can put_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tube in the tire , and get_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) them back onto the rim of the wheel .
 Now , pedal_(ScrEv_ride_bike) fast , to make_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) for lost time !

 I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) by bicycle along the river trail this morning when I noticed_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that something did n't seem_(UnrelEv) right .
 My front tire was_(UnrelEv) n't as firm as it usually is_(UnrelEv) , and the situation was getting_(UnrelEv) worse .
 I stopped_(RelNScrEv) pedaling_(ScrEv_ride_bike) , got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bike , and put_(ScrEv_examine_tire) my ear to the tire .
 I could hear_(ScrEv_examine_tire) a faint hissing_(RelNScrEv) sound .
 The tire was_(RelNScrEv) flat .
 Darn , I thought_(UnrelEv) to myself .
 I was_(UnrelEv) miles from home -- too far to walk_(RelNScrEv) back , and nowhere near a repair shop .
 Fortunately , I keep_(ScrEv_get_tools) a patch kit that I bought_(ScrEv_get_tools) at the local bike shop in my backpack .
 I took_(RelNScrEv) the backpack off , rummaged_(RelNScrEv) around inside for the repair kit , and grabbed_(ScrEv_get_tools) it .
 It had been_(UnrelEv) a year since I last used_(RelNScrEv) it , but I got_(UnrelEv) the hang of it .
 I found_(ScrEv_examine_tire) the exact spot of the hole in the tire , patched_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) it , and then re-inflated_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tire .
 My hands were_(UnrelEv) dirty , but I was_(UnrelEv) able to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) home without any further trouble .

 The other day I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike out on the local scenic bike trail .
 A few miles into my ride , I was trying_(UnrelEv) to dodge_(UnrelEv) a runner that was n't paying_(UnrelEv) attention and I ended_(UnrelEv) up running_(UnrelEv) over a piece of debris in the trail .
 I started_(UnrelEv) noticing_(ScrEv_notice_problem) that it was getting_(UnrelEv) harder to pedal_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike , so I stopped_(UnrelEv) to evaluate_(UnrelEv) the situation .
 Once I looked_(UnrelEv) at the tire , I realized_(ScrEv_notice_problem) it was flat and that I needed_(UnrelEv) to repair_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 Thankfully , I kept_(RelNScrEv) tire repair supplies in my bag for situations just like this !
 I placed_(ScrEv_put_patch/seal) a temporary patch on the tire and used_(UnrelEv) my portable pump to inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) it again .
 I set_(UnrelEv) off to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) again , and the same thing happened_(UnrelEv) .
 I had to temporarily repair_(Evoking) the tire three more times just to make_(UnrelEv) it back to my car .
 Once I made_(UnrelEv) it home , I removed_(ScrEv_remove_tire) the tire and placed_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) a new one on .
 That 's_(UnrelEv) how I repaired_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) flat_(Evoking) bicycle_(Evoking) tire_(Evoking) .

 I began_(UnrelEv) by finding_(ScrEv_notice_problem) the culprit of my flat tire , it was_(UnrelEv) a nail on the side of the road .
 Unfortunately I did not have_(UnrelEv) a spare tire so I had to carry_(ScrEv_other) my bike the rest of the way home .
 After the gruesome trek back to my house I flipped_(ScrEv_lay_bike_down) the bicycle upside down and began_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) repair_(Evoking) .
 First I took_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) off the outer tire to replace_(RelNScrEv) my tube with a better more expensive tube that has_(UnrelEv) the ability to fix_(RelNScrEv) a puncture .
 I do not want_(UnrelEv) to experience_(UnrelEv) carrying_(RelNScrEv) my bike a mile ever again .
 After putting_(ScrEv_other) the new tube on I screw_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) back on the tire and put the outer tire over the tube .
 I then fill_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the PSI to 170 in my tire and listen_(ScrEv_check_new_tire) for any leaking_(RelNScrEv) air .
 Then I spin_(ScrEv_other) the tire to make_(UnrelEv) all the slime inside become evenly distributed_(UnrelEv) throughout .
 This will prevent_(RelNScrEv) leaks in the future and even with a slight leak I will still be able to ride_(ScrEv_ride_bike) back home and fix_(RelNScrEv) the tire quickly yet again .

 I was riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) my bike home from school one day when I went_(UnrelEv) through a thorny patch of ground while going_(UnrelEv) through the park .
 The tire then went_(RelNScrEv) flat after a few more minutes of riding_(ScrEv_ride_bike) and I was stuck_(UnrelEv) a couple of miles from home .
 I called_(UnrelEv) my dad and told_(UnrelEv) him what happened_(UnrelEv) and where I was_(UnrelEv) .
 After a few minutes , he showed_(UnrelEv) up with new inner tubes and a few tools to help_(UnrelEv) me fix_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) bike_(Evoking) tires_(Evoking) .
 We started_(UnrelEv) by removing_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the outer rubber of the tires and getting_(ScrEv_take_tire_off) the damaged inner tubes out .
 Then we replaced_(ScrEv_remove_tire) them with new ones .
 After reinstalling_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) the tubes and putting_(ScrEv_put_new_tire) them back onto the bicycle , we had to inflate_(ScrEv_refill_tire_air) the tires which took_(RelNScrEv) a few minutes with a foot pump .
 Afterwards , he drove_(UnrelEv) home and I followed_(UnrelEv) on my repaired_(RelNScrEv) bike .
 I promised_(UnrelEv) to avoid_(UnrelEv) patches of thorns after that since it cost_(UnrelEv) me 2 weeks of allowance to buy_(ScrEv_get_tire) the inner tubes .

 Yesterday I rode_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to go_(UnrelEv) to work .
 I woke_(UnrelEv) up early because the bus is_(UnrelEv) very very very unreliable .
 I packed_(UnrelEv) the items that I needed_(UnrelEv) for the day in my backpack .
 I double_(ScrEv_other) checked_(ScrEv_other) to make_(UnrelEv) sure I had_(UnrelEv) everything , including_(UnrelEv) my one dollar and twenty five cents bus fare .

 Riding_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) n't something I look_(UnrelEv) forward_(UnrelEv) to doing_(UnrelEv) .
 When I was_(UnrelEv) a teenager some friends convinced_(UnrelEv) me that it would be_(UnrelEv) fun to jump_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) a bus and ride_(ScrEv_ride) around_(ScrEv_ride) .
 Having done_(UnrelEv) so , I disagree_(UnrelEv) , it is_(UnrelEv) n't fun .
 However , for some people the bus is_(UnrelEv) the only mode of transportation available .
 Riding_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) does require_(UnrelEv) a little research .
 You have to know_(UnrelEv) which line you are riding_(ScrEv_ride) , whether it is_(UnrelEv) an express or whether it will be making_(ScrEv_bus_stops) many stops .
 You must also have_(RelNScrEv) the appropriate amount of fare ready to pay_(ScrEv_get_ticket) .
 Once on board the bus , it 's_(UnrelEv) best to find_(ScrEv_find_place) a hopefully clean seat nearby a normal looking_(UnrelEv) person .
 Since bus fare is_(UnrelEv) quite cheap and anyone can use_(Evoking) it , they do tend_(UnrelEv) to attract_(UnrelEv) undesirable types , so it 's_(UnrelEv) best to be_(UnrelEv) aware_(UnrelEv) of that fact and watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) yourself and your belongings closely .
 Listen_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) and watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) you do n't miss_(RelNScrEv) your stop , since busses do get_(UnrelEv) crowded_(RelNScrEv) and you do n't want_(UnrelEv) to miss_(RelNScrEv) it .

 Yesterday , I stood_(ScrEv_wait) at the bus stop for over twenty minutes waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for VTA bus 323 to show_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up_(ScrEv_bus_comes) at my stop at my community college .

 Before arriving_(ScrEv_bus_stops) at the stop , I pulled_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the cord to initiate_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the voice recording which states_(RelNScrEv) '' `` Stop Requested_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) '' '' .
 The bus driver pulled_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to the side , I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) my backpack and all my other belongings and headed_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus .

 One afternoon , I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) to the library to check_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) some books and movies .
 It was_(UnrelEv) too far away to walk_(UnrelEv) , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 I found_(UnrelEv) a map and looked_(UnrelEv) for my home and the library .
 On the map , there was_(UnrelEv) a symbol that stood_(UnrelEv) for '' `` Bus '' '' at a street corner a block from where I lived_(UnrelEv) .
 There was_(UnrelEv) another symbol for the bus on the road right in front of the library .
 I looked_(ScrEv_find_bus) up_(ScrEv_find_bus) the name of each of these stops on the map , and it said_(UnrelEv) that the Number 5 bus goes_(RelNScrEv) to both of these stops .
 It also listed_(UnrelEv) what times the Number 5 bus arrives_(ScrEv_bus_comes) at each of these stops .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) a few minutes before the bus was_(UnrelEv) due_(UnrelEv) to arrive_(ScrEv_bus_comes) at the stop at my street corner , I checked_(RelNScrEv) my piggy bank and took_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) some dollar bills and quarters , and then I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop .
 After waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for a few minutes , a big bus that said_(UnrelEv) '' `` Number 5 '' '' pulled_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up_(ScrEv_bus_comes) , and the driver opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) the door .
 I walked_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) and read_(RelNScrEv) the sign explaining_(UnrelEv) the fare .
 I paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) exactly what the sign said_(UnrelEv) into the machine near the driver and found_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat near the middle of the bus .
 As the bus drove_(ScrEv_ride) down the road , the names of each stop appeared_(RelNScrEv) in writing near the front of the bus .
 An electronic voice also said_(RelNScrEv) the names out loud so that the deaf would know_(UnrelEv) what stop they are approaching_(ScrEv_other) .
 Sometimes the bus driver would stop_(ScrEv_bus_stops) and let_(ScrEv_board_bus) more people on board , and sometimes people got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 Sometimes there was nobody waiting_(ScrEv_wait) at a stop and nobody trying_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) , so the driver kept_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) moving_(ScrEv_ride) .
 When I saw_(RelNScrEv) the name of the stop outside the library appear_(RelNScrEv) , I pulled_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) a big yellow cord hanging_(UnrelEv) above the window .
 This made_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) a noise and notified_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the bus driver that I wanted_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) at this stop .
 He stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) the bus when we arrived_(ScrEv_bus_stops) , opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) the doors , and I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) to enjoy_(UnrelEv) my afternoon at the library .

 I live_(UnrelEv) near the city of Santa Cruz and often take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) 17X_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to the nearby city of San Jose .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) possible to get_(RelNScrEv) discount fares by paying_(RelNScrEv) for multiple rides in advance , but I usually pay_(RelNScrEv) cash , five dollars for one-way .
 I get_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to my small town 's transit center early on weekday mornings , because the bus fills_(RelNScrEv) up quickly , and most good seats are already taken_(RelNScrEv) by riders who started_(UnrelEv) their trip in downtown Santa Cruz .
 We wait_(ScrEv_wait) in line in civilized fashion .
 Some people need only show_(RelNScrEv) the driver their pass , some shove_(RelNScrEv) a five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently .
 But some fumble_(UnrelEv) with small coins or ask_(RelNScrEv) other riders for change , which makes_(UnrelEv) everyone in line restive .
 Once on , riders can choose_(ScrEv_find_place) seats grouped_(UnrelEv) around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways .
 Table seats are_(UnrelEv) premium , since the bus has_(RelNScrEv) WiFi and many people bring_(UnrelEv) laptops .
 Others prefer_(UnrelEv) seats in the back where the roughnecks are_(UnrelEv) , just like in high school .
 My little town is_(UnrelEv) the last stop before highway 17 .
 The bus whips_(RelNScrEv) along amid the pine trees and the yellow-flowered acacia that blooms_(UnrelEv) this time of year .
 It is_(UnrelEv) pleasant not to have to keep_(UnrelEv) your eyes on the road .
 Unspoken_(UnrelEv) bus etiquette decrees_(UnrelEv) that strangers do n't speak_(UnrelEv) to each other , but of course some people know each other and chat_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) .
 Many tap_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) away on their machines or play_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) video games , others read_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) books or enjoy_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) the ride .
 It ends_(UnrelEv) at San Jose 's train station , where passengers can transfer_(ScrEv_change_bus) to the San Francisco train , or take_(RelNScrEv) a rattling inferior 1-hour bus ride to Fremont to catch_(RelNScrEv) the BART mass transit line to Oakland , Richmond , or distant Pittsburg , where the California Delta begins_(UnrelEv) .

 I walk_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) a few blocks from my home to the local bus stop picking_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) a newspaper along the way .
 As the bus arrives_(ScrEv_bus_comes) I prepare_(UnrelEv) to remove_(RelNScrEv) money from my wallet for the fare .
 As the bus stops_(ScrEv_bus_comes) the doors open_(ScrEv_door_opens) and I walk_(ScrEv_board_bus) up_(ScrEv_board_bus) the metal steps and stop_(UnrelEv) to pay_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my fare to the driver .
 The bus is_(UnrelEv) partially full but with enough seats to choose_(ScrEv_find_place) from I select_(ScrEv_find_place) a window seat .
 Being_(UnrelEv) a warm day I open_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) the window a crack to get_(UnrelEv) a breeze on me .
 During my ride just out of curiosity I check_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) all of the other passengers before settling_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) my newspaper .
 I check_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) the local scores in the sports section first then continue_(UnrelEv) to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) the remainder of the paper .
 As the bus nears_(ScrEv_bus_stops) my stop I get_(ScrEv_go_exit) up_(ScrEv_go_exit) and walk_(ScrEv_go_exit) to the exit waiting_(RelNScrEv) for the door to open_(ScrEv_door_opens) then depart_(ScrEv_get_off) .

 Last week , my friend and I rode_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) into town .
 We looked_(ScrEv_check_time-table) at_(ScrEv_check_time-table) a bus schedule and found_(ScrEv_find_bus) the bus stop closest to our homes .
 We got_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) the bus stop ten minutes before our bus was supposed_(UnrelEv) to arrive_(ScrEv_bus_comes) and waited_(ScrEv_wait) .
 When it arrived_(ScrEv_bus_comes) , we got_(RelNScrEv) into_(RelNScrEv) the line to board_(ScrEv_board_bus) .
 Each person in front of us climbed_(ScrEv_board_bus) the steps and put_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a token into the machine at the front of the bus .
 We had_(UnrelEv) no token , so we gave_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the bus driver our money and he gave_(ScrEv_get_ticket) us tokens to put_(ScrEv_get_ticket) in_(ScrEv_get_ticket) .
 We found_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat at the back of the bus and sat_(ScrEv_find_place) down_(ScrEv_find_place) .
 We checked_(ScrEv_check_time-table) our bus schedule and decided_(ScrEv_find_bus) where we wanted to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 When the sign at the front of the bus showed_(RelNScrEv) that it was_(ScrEv_bus_stops) our stop , we gathered_(RelNScrEv) our things and prepared_(ScrEv_go_exit) to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 After we got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) , we made_(UnrelEv) a note of which bus stop we were_(UnrelEv) at and the time the bus would be_(ScrEv_bus_comes) there again to take_(Evoking) us_(Evoking) home_(Evoking) .
 Then we went_(UnrelEv) off_(UnrelEv) to explore_(UnrelEv) the town .

 Before leaving_(RelNScrEv) my house , I check_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the bus schedule on the internet .
 I noticed_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the bus was running_(RelNScrEv) late_(RelNScrEv) today , but I went_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) outside to wait_(ScrEv_wait) at the bus stop anyway .
 The bus actually arrived_(ScrEv_bus_comes) even later than it was estimated_(UnrelEv) on the internet .
 I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) onto_(ScrEv_board_bus) the bus after the arriving_(Unclear) passengers exited_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 I paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) with exact change into the money collector .
 There were_(UnrelEv) no empty seats on the bus and almost all the places to stand_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) were_(UnrelEv) full too .
 I found_(ScrEv_find_place) a spot next to a man who smelled_(UnrelEv) like he was eating_(UnrelEv) onions .
 For the next 22 blocks I had to smell_(UnrelEv) him before he exited_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus .
 The next person who stood_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) by me was_(UnrelEv) a morbidly obese man who liked_(UnrelEv) to talk_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) about anything he could think_(UnrelEv) of .
 I tried_(UnrelEv) to just look_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) out the window because it was_(UnrelEv) so uncomfortable .
 Finally , seven blocks later I was_(UnrelEv) at my stop and I could not have been_(UnrelEv) more relieved .

 Yesterday , I went_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus with a few others .
 The bus arrived_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 When I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on , I scanned_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my bus pass on the bus pass scanner and then took_(ScrEv_find_place) my seat .
 The bus was_(UnrelEv) not crowded_(RelNScrEv) , so I was able to take_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat near the front .
 I sat_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) quietly , playing_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) with my cellphone .
 Others stared_(UnrelEv) around or talked_(UnrelEv) quietly amongst themselves .
 A bell rang_(ScrEv_other) every few blocks to indicate_(UnrelEv) someone wanting_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off .
 The bus would stop_(ScrEv_bus_stops) , let_(ScrEv_get_off) people off , and let_(ScrEv_board_bus) new people on .
 The bus started_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) crowded_(RelNScrEv) so I offered_(ScrEv_other) my seat to an older woman .

 I saw_(UnrelEv) my stop coming_(ScrEv_other) up , so I pulled_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the lever and the bell rang_(ScrEv_other) again .

 My car had broken_(UnrelEv) down so I needed to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to work on Wednesday morning .
 First I looked_(ScrEv_other) on-line to see_(UnrelEv) which bus I should take_(RelNScrEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) to McLean , and what bus stop was_(RelNScrEv) the closest to my home .
 The instructions were_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) to Seven Corners shopping center , catch_(ScrEv_board_bus) the 3A to Tyson Corner , and then transfer_(ScrEv_change_bus) to the 18A to get_(RelNScrEv) within a block of my office .
 In the morning I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) up to the shopping center and waited_(ScrEv_wait) until the bus came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on , paying_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the driver with change and dollar bills .
 I confirmed_(RelNScrEv) with the driver that this was_(UnrelEv) the correct bus to go_(RelNScrEv) to Tyson Corner and transfer_(RelNScrEv) .
 I chose_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat near the front so I could make_(UnrelEv) sure I did not miss_(RelNScrEv) my next stop .
 I transferred_(ScrEv_change_bus) at Tyson Corner to the 18A , which took_(RelNScrEv) me within a block of my work place .

 As my car was not working_(UnrelEv) correctly I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 I called_(RelNScrEv) the bus depot and asked_(RelNScrEv) how much tickets where_(UnrelEv) and the departure times .
 The rates where_(UnrelEv) reasonable for what I needed_(UnrelEv) and I really did n't have_(UnrelEv) a choice in the matter as my own car was_(UnrelEv) messed up .
 I had a friend take_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) me to the bus stop where I purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my round trip ticket and prepared_(UnrelEv) to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus to load_(ScrEv_board_bus) and leave_(ScrEv_bus_leaves) to take_(ScrEv_ride) me to my destination .

 My gun was_(UnrelEv) fine so I tucked_(UnrelEv) it under my shirt and boarded_(ScrEv_board_bus) the bus .
 I found_(ScrEv_find_bus) a seat near the back where I could see_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) most of the other passengers and kicked_(Unclear) back_(Unclear) to make_(ScrEv_ride) the trip .

 I ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to school everyday .
 I live_(UnrelEv) in New York City so riding_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) a common thing .
 Everyone does_(RelNScrEv) it because it is_(UnrelEv) convenient .
 In our city , it is_(UnrelEv) very packed , so driving_(UnrelEv) is_(UnrelEv) n't as convenient or affordable .
 Parking_(UnrelEv) is expensive so public transportation saves_(RelNScrEv) us a lot of money .
 Every morning when I go_(UnrelEv) to school , I wait_(ScrEv_wait) by the bus stop .
 The morning bus comes_(RelNScrEv) every ten minutes .
 Once it arrives_(ScrEv_bus_comes) I board_(ScrEv_board_bus) onto the bus and I insert_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my metro card .
 The metro card has_(RelNScrEv) a balance of money stored_(RelNScrEv) inside it .
 This money is_(UnrelEv) subtracted_(RelNScrEv) from the balance every time I ride_(RelNScrEv) the bus and insert_(RelNScrEv) my metro card .
 Basically the metro card pays_(RelNScrEv) for the bus ride .
 When I run_(UnrelEv) out of money , I go_(RelNScrEv) to a metro card machine and put_(RelNScrEv) more money into my balance .
 Riding_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) annoying sometimes .
 In the morning , it is_(RelNScrEv) very crowded so sometimes there are_(RelNScrEv) n't enough seats for everybody .
 This means_(UnrelEv) I have to stand_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) while holding_(RelNScrEv) on to a pole .
 Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched_(UnrelEv) in between people .
 If I am_(UnrelEv) lucky , sometimes there will be_(RelNScrEv) open seats .
 Otherwise , I have to stand_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) for 40 minutes .

 I then walked_(RelNScrEv) to the back of the bus and picked_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat that looked_(UnrelEv) comfortable .
 After everyone else had sat_(ScrEv_find_place) down_(ScrEv_find_place) , the bus began_(UnrelEv) to move_(ScrEv_ride) .

 So I decided_(UnrelEv) the best thing to do_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to work .
 I got_(ScrEv_check_time-table) a bus schedule and found_(ScrEv_find_bus) the nearest bus stop to my house and went_(ScrEv_check_time-table) over_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the times of the buses .

 The trick to getting_(UnrelEv) around_(UnrelEv) an island as congested_(UnrelEv) with traffic as Oahu , is_(UnrelEv) to ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 There are_(UnrelEv) too many cars , in too small of an area , and the result is_(UnrelEv) hours of gridlock on the roads .
 The bus can use_(UnrelEv) special lanes , and helps_(UnrelEv) reduce_(UnrelEv) the overall traffic .
 Learning_(UnrelEv) to ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) a little stressful at first .
 I studied_(ScrEv_check_time-table) bus routes online on their website , there are_(UnrelEv) quite a few and it seemed_(UnrelEv) like it 'd be_(UnrelEv) easy to get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) the wrong bus .
 I learned_(UnrelEv) each bus has_(UnrelEv) a number assigned_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) it and displayed_(UnrelEv) on the front though .
 With that in mind , and armed_(UnrelEv) with maps , I learned_(UnrelEv) to stand_(ScrEv_wait) at my local bus stop and climb_(ScrEv_board_bus) on board where I drop_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my change into the toll taker next to the driver .
 I always look_(ScrEv_find_place) for_(ScrEv_find_place) an empty seat , and then relax_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) , watching_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) the scenery roll_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) .
 As my stop approaches_(ScrEv_bus_stops) , I stand_(RelNScrEv) and pull_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the bell , and the driver stops_(ScrEv_bus_stops) the bus .
 Now that I regularly ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) , I find_(UnrelEv) I do n't mind_(UnrelEv) the long commute nearly as much !

 We stood_(ScrEv_wait) there waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for about ten minutes for the bus to come_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 When it arrived_(ScrEv_bus_comes) people rushed_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and we boarded_(ScrEv_board_bus) one by one .
 We each swiped_(RelNScrEv) our bus pass and searched_(ScrEv_find_place) for a seat .
 There were_(UnrelEv) some people who took_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) two seats and the aroma of breath lingered_(UnrelEv) in the air .
 Each stop a bell rang_(RelNScrEv) letting_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the driver know_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) passengers wanted_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 It took_(UnrelEv) us ten stop to get_(ScrEv_ride) to the museum but it seemed_(UnrelEv) like forever .
 My teacher pressed_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the button and we all ran_(UnrelEv) to the museum doors happy to be_(UnrelEv) free .

 The bus stop was_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) three and a half blocks away .
 I checked_(RelNScrEv) my watch .

 I arrived_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) at the bench with a few minutes to spare_(ScrEv_wait) .
 I sat_(RelNScrEv) on the bench underneath the rain awning and read_(RelNScrEv) my book until I noticed_(UnrelEv) the bus approaching_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 I stood_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) , closed_(UnrelEv) my book , and fished_(RelNScrEv) through_(RelNScrEv) my purse for my metrocard .

 I was_(UnrelEv) glad to have enough left_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) for my return trip .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) my metrocard away and walked_(ScrEv_find_place) toward the back of the bus .
 There was_(UnrelEv) an empty seat near the window and I sat_(ScrEv_find_place) down_(ScrEv_find_place) .
 I gazed_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) out the window , choosing_(UnrelEv) not to continue_(UnrelEv) reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) my book because it makes_(RelNScrEv) me carsick .
 When the bus neared_(ScrEv_bus_stops) my destination , I pressed_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the button to request_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) a stop .
 The bus stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) and I said_(RelNScrEv) excuse me to a few fellow passengers as I made_(ScrEv_go_exit) my way to the back door .
 I touched_(ScrEv_other) the tape on the doors and they opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) automatically .
 I gave_(RelNScrEv) a wave of thanks to the bus driver and stepped_(ScrEv_get_off) down_(ScrEv_get_off) carefully onto the curb .

 Late last week on my way home from work I got_(UnrelEv) into an accident that damaged_(UnrelEv) my car .
 Luckily everyone who was involved_(UnrelEv) came_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) uninjured_(UnrelEv) but my car was damaged_(UnrelEv) and would have to spend_(UnrelEv) about two weeks in the shop .
 Since my insurance did not cover_(UnrelEv) a rent_(UnrelEv) a car this meant_(UnrelEv) that I had to take_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) transportation_(Evoking) for the next couple of weeks to get_(UnrelEv) to work .
 I was_(UnrelEv) fortunate to have_(UnrelEv) a bus stop only a couple of blocks from my house so I would walk_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop and wait_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus with the other people .
 Some people talked_(RelNScrEv) to one another and others like myself had_(RelNScrEv) headphones in , listening_(RelNScrEv) to_(RelNScrEv) music .
 It is_(UnrelEv) not that I am_(UnrelEv) against talking_(RelNScrEv) to people I am_(UnrelEv) just not really a morning person and do not feel_(UnrelEv) like it at 7AM .
 The bus pulled_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up_(ScrEv_bus_comes) and we got_(RelNScrEv) in line to board_(ScrEv_board_bus) and showed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) him our ticket to ride_(ScrEv_ride) .

 I live_(UnrelEv) in an area with good train and bus coverage .
 I typically choose_(UnrelEv) the train as it is_(UnrelEv) more predictable but for some parts of the city that the train can not reach_(UnrelEv) , I will take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 The bus stations are_(UnrelEv) typically outdoors so depending_(UnrelEv) on where I 'm going_(UnrelEv) I 'll head_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the nearest bus stop .
 There 's_(UnrelEv) an app that shoes_(ScrEv_check_time-table) when the next bus is coming_(ScrEv_bus_comes) so I 'll take_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) my phone to see_(ScrEv_check_time-table) how long the wait is_(ScrEv_wait) .
 Typically the wait is_(ScrEv_wait) about 10-15 minutes .
 Once the bus arrives_(ScrEv_bus_comes) , I take_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) my transit card to tap_(ScrEv_get_ticket) on the machine that collects_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the fare .
 This is done_(UnrelEv) at the very beginning at the entrance of the bus .
 Once I hear_(RelNScrEv) the beep notifying_(RelNScrEv) me that the fare has been collected_(ScrEv_get_ticket) I will take_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat upstairs if it 's_(UnrelEv) a double decker bus .
 The view is_(UnrelEv) much better from the top and there are_(UnrelEv) usually seats at the top .

 Well I have_(UnrelEv) a perfect solution for you , and it 's_(UnrelEv) right under your nose .

 Once paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) , simply find_(ScrEv_find_place) an open seat and gaze_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) out the window at the bustling of life that you are passing_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) .

 Last weekend there was_(UnrelEv) a parade in the downtown area of my city , and I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(UnrelEv) my little sister - we had_(UnrelEv) so much fun !
 I 'm_(UnrelEv) not old enough to drive_(UnrelEv) and our parents were_(UnrelEv) busy , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) online_(RelNScrEv) and looked_(ScrEv_find_bus) at the bus route to determine_(ScrEv_find_bus) which stop let_(ScrEv_get_off) us off closest to the parade , and then I looked_(ScrEv_check_time-table) at the bus schedule to see_(ScrEv_check_time-table) what time the bus would come_(ScrEv_bus_comes) and how often it ran_(RelNScrEv) .
 I also found_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) how much the ride costs_(RelNScrEv) , and Mom gave_(UnrelEv) me the money I needed_(UnrelEv) for both of us .
 The day of the parade my sister and I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) the two short blocks to the bus stop and waited_(ScrEv_wait) inside the little bus shelter .
 When the bus came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) , the driver came_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to a stop and the doors opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) and we walked_(ScrEv_board_bus) up_(ScrEv_board_bus) the two steps .
 We said_(RelNScrEv) hello to the driver and paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the fare - my sister loved_(UnrelEv) putting_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the coins in the fare box .
 We walked_(ScrEv_find_place) a few steps down the aisle and took_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat near the front of the bus and settled_(ScrEv_find_place) in_(ScrEv_find_place) to look_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) out of the window .
 The bus made_(ScrEv_bus_stops) a lot of stops and all types of people got_(Unclear) on and off of the bus ; it was_(UnrelEv) pretty noisy !
 When I could tell_(UnrelEv) we were getting_(RelNScrEv) close_(RelNScrEv) to our stop , I pulled_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the chord to alert_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the driver that we were getting_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) at the next stop .
 When we reached_(ScrEv_bus_stops) our stop , my sister and I walked_(ScrEv_go_exit) down the aisle and off of the bus .
 We were_(UnrelEv) just in time to see_(UnrelEv) the beginning of the parade !

 I selected_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat near the entrance , because it has_(RelNScrEv) more space and fewer people .
 Riding_(RelNScrEv) the bus often gives_(RelNScrEv) me motion sickness , so I closed_(UnrelEv) my eyes and tried_(UnrelEv) to ignore_(UnrelEv) the swaying_(UnrelEv) motion as it rolled_(RelNScrEv) down the street .

 This is_(UnrelEv) especially important if I am going to be buying_(UnrelEv) anything else that day .
 Some bus systems have_(UnrelEv) a special price for certain groups , like students .
 I am able to use_(UnrelEv) my student ID card to get_(UnrelEv) a discounted rate .
 I have_(UnrelEv) a bus schedule at home where I can easily check_(ScrEv_check_time-table) it , but I have it memorized_(UnrelEv) because I use_(UnrelEv) it so much .
 I make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I leave_(RelNScrEv) to go_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop so that I get_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) there about five minutes early .
 Usually the bus is_(UnrelEv) on time , as long as there have_(UnrelEv) n't been any issues that day .
 When the bus arrives_(ScrEv_bus_comes) , I first check_(RelNScrEv) that it is_(UnrelEv) the bus number for where I want to go_(RelNScrEv) , as different bus lines go_(RelNScrEv) to different areas of the city .
 When I get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) the bus , I have to show_(RelNScrEv) my ID and pay_(ScrEv_get_ticket) , and then I can go_(ScrEv_find_place) to a seat .
 Sometimes the bus can be_(UnrelEv) pretty full , and I have to sit_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) next to someone else .
 A lot of the same people will often ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) with me , so I get_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) know_(UnrelEv) them .
 I will sometimes bring_(UnrelEv) a book with me to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) while I ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 I make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to pay_(RelNScrEv) attention to what stop we are_(UnrelEv) at , and start_(UnrelEv) to prepare_(RelNScrEv) one stop ahead of where I need to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus .
 Once I arrive_(ScrEv_bus_stops) at my bus stop , I walk_(ScrEv_go_exit) to the front of the bus and thank_(RelNScrEv) the driver , then hop_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and continue_(UnrelEv) with whatever I need to do_(UnrelEv) that day .

 I needed to get_(UnrelEv) from my house to work , but my car wouldn ' t start_(UnrelEv) .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) my best option was_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) down_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) the street to the nearest bus stop that would take_(Unclear) me close to work .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) for about five minutes for the bus to come_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 Once I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) , I put_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my money in the machine and headed_(RelNScrEv) towards the back to find_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat .
 There were_(UnrelEv) only three open seats so I took_(ScrEv_find_place) one of them and popped_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) my ear buds to listen_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) to_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) music .
 I also brought_(RelNScrEv) a book along to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) so nobody would try_(UnrelEv) to talk_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) to_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) me .
 The bus made_(ScrEv_bus_stops) three stops before we got_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to_(ScrEv_bus_stops) the corner nearest to my work .
 Each time people would get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and as they shuffled_(ScrEv_go_exit) past_(ScrEv_go_exit) would bump_(RelNScrEv) into my knees which was really annoying_(UnrelEv) .
 Then more people would get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) and some would find_(ScrEv_find_place) seats , but others had to stand_(ScrEv_find_place) .
 One person stood_(ScrEv_find_place) directly in front of me , in constant contact with my legs .
 This really annoyed_(UnrelEv) me even more .
 I don ' t like_(UnrelEv) riding_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) transportation_(Evoking) .
 Finally we got_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to_(ScrEv_bus_stops) my stop and I got_(ScrEv_get_off) out_(ScrEv_get_off) of the bus through the rear doors .

 My car is_(UnrelEv) in the repair shop so I had to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to work yesterday .
 The first thing I did_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) walk_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop at the corner and then waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus to arrive_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 I watched_(ScrEv_other) the signs on the front of the buses as they approached_(UnrelEv) so I would know_(UnrelEv) which one to take_(RelNScrEv) .
 When I saw_(UnrelEv) the right one , I stood_(ScrEv_other) up so the driver would know_(UnrelEv) I want to ride_(ScrEv_ride) .

 I climbed_(ScrEv_board_bus) the steps and the bus driver said_(RelNScrEv) hello .
 You can buy_(RelNScrEv) a bus pass if you ride_(ScrEv_ride) the bus a lot , but I do_(UnrelEv) n't so I do n't have_(UnrelEv) a pass .
 Instead , I put_(ScrEv_get_ticket) coins into the money receiver beside the bus driver and then I walked_(ScrEv_other) to where the seats are .
 The bus was_(UnrelEv) only about half full , so I chose_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat by myself and sat_(ScrEv_find_place) down by the window .
 Once the bus started_(ScrEv_other) again , there was_(UnrelEv) a little jerking motion as it moved_(ScrEv_ride) forward and then we were rolling_(ScrEv_ride) down the street .
 While I was sitting_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) , I did n't touch_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) anything in case it was dirty .
 Instead , I kept_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) my hands in my lap and watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) people , cars and buildings out of the window .
 A nice lady in the seat across from me smiled_(UnrelEv) at me , but no one else paid_(UnrelEv) attention to me and when the bus stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) I got_(ScrEv_other) up along with several other people and climbed_(ScrEv_get_off) down to the street again .

 Yesterday I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to the zoo .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) over to the bus stop and sat_(UnrelEv) down on the bench while I waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus to arrive_(RelNScrEv) .
 There was_(RelNScrEv) a map of all the bus routes at the stop , so I looked_(ScrEv_other) on there to make_(UnrelEv) sure I knew_(UnrelEv) which bus would take_(RelNScrEv) me to the zoo .
 I saw_(UnrelEv) I needed_(UnrelEv) bus number 12 .
 Sure enough , there came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) number 12 .

 I took_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat and off we went_(ScrEv_other) .
 I watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) all the buildings go_(UnrelEv) by as the driver drove_(ScrEv_ride) the bus towards the zoo .

 '' `` Riding_(Evoking) A_(Evoking) Public_(Evoking) Bus_(Evoking) '' '' Hannah and her mommy had just moved_(UnrelEv) to the city .
 Daddy took_(UnrelEv) the car to work each day now and her and mommy decided_(UnrelEv) they wanted_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) the shopping center .
 Hannah was excited_(UnrelEv) because today was_(UnrelEv) her first time taking_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 Hannah and her family had moved_(UnrelEv) to Portland , Maine and the bus they were taking_(Evoking) was called_(UnrelEv) the Metro .
 Hannah took_(UnrelEv) her mom 's hand as they walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) down_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) the sunny streets of the city until they reached_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) a sign that Hannah could not read_(UnrelEv) but she did understand_(UnrelEv) the picture .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a picture of a bus . ''
 `` Does that sign say_(UnrelEv) bus mommy ? '' ''
 Hannah asked_(UnrelEv) .
 Her mother replied_(UnrelEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) and it was_(UnrelEv) one of many many places around the city to get_(UnrelEv) the bus to stop_(ScrEv_bus_stops) for them and others .
 They waited_(ScrEv_wait) for a long while and finally a large public bus came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) down_(ScrEv_bus_comes) the street and stopped_(ScrEv_bus_comes) before them .
 They waited_(RelNScrEv) while a few passengers exited_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus because her mom said_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) the polite thing to do_(UnrelEv) and then they climbed_(ScrEv_board_bus) the steps where her mother dropped_(ScrEv_get_ticket) their coins into the busses toll collector .
 Her mother then asked_(ScrEv_get_ticket) for a transfer and they walked_(ScrEv_find_place) quickly to their seats .
 Hannah asked_(UnrelEv) her mom what a transfer was_(UnrelEv) and she explained_(UnrelEv) that because they were going_(UnrelEv) way across the city they would need to get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) yet another bus and the transfer was_(UnrelEv) so the other bus driver could see_(UnrelEv) they already paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) for their ride .
 Soon the bus jolted_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to another stop an older lady stepped_(ScrEv_board_bus) onto_(ScrEv_board_bus) the bus and flashed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a card at the bus driver and took_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat at the front of the bus that was saved_(UnrelEv) for elderly and handicapped people .
 Hannah tugged_(UnrelEv) at her moms sleeve and whispered_(UnrelEv) the lady did not pay_(ScrEv_get_ticket) .
 Her mother quietly told_(UnrelEv) her she had_(RelNScrEv) a bus pass that she paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than just one ride .
 That people who use_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) daily buy_(ScrEv_get_ticket) them to save_(UnrelEv) money .
 Hannah thought_(UnrelEv) to herself she would like_(UnrelEv) bus passes for her and mommy .
 She enjoyed_(ScrEv_ride) the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and wide turns that made_(UnrelEv) her have to hold_(RelNScrEv) on_(RelNScrEv) tight .
 Hannah also noticed_(UnrelEv) people pulling_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) a cord and she figured_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) why .
 It made_(UnrelEv) the bus driver stop_(ScrEv_bus_stops) where ever they would like to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 Oh how she wanted_(UnrelEv) to pull_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the string but , mommy told_(UnrelEv) her no .
 It was_(UnrelEv) only for when you needed_(UnrelEv) it .
 Soon the bus stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) at the busy bus station .
 They stepped_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus and got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) a new bus .
 Her mom handed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the bus driver their transfers .
 Hannah was excited_(UnrelEv) because this meant_(UnrelEv) the next place they were going_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) the shopping center to buy_(UnrelEv) her new shoes .
 Soon the bus took_(ScrEv_bus_leaves) off_(ScrEv_bus_leaves) and made_(ScrEv_bus_stops) stop after stop .
 They even picked_(ScrEv_board_bus) up_(ScrEv_board_bus) a man in a wheelchair .
 He drove_(ScrEv_board_bus) his wheelchair right up a special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled_(RelNScrEv) him and his wheelchair in .
 Soon Hannah 's mom told_(UnrelEv) her she could pull_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the cord to make_(UnrelEv) the bus stop_(ScrEv_bus_stops) .
 The cord was_(UnrelEv) up high but with a little help from her mom she reached_(UnrelEv) it .
 Ding !
 The bus came_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to a stop shortly after and there was_(UnrelEv) the shopping center right in front of them .
 Taking_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) a fun form of transportation .

 I made_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) I had_(UnrelEv) enough fare and left_(RelNScrEv) the house .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop and there was_(UnrelEv) two elderly people waiting_(ScrEv_wait) before me .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) on line and short time later I saw_(UnrelEv) the bus coming_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 The bus stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) in front of us and the elderly people got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) first .
 I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) the bus after them and then paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my bus fare .
 I could n't find_(ScrEv_find_place) any seats so I held_(ScrEv_find_place) on the the metal handles provided_(UnrelEv) in the bus so I would n't fall_(RelNScrEv) .
 After awhile I saw_(RelNScrEv) that my destination was_(UnrelEv) near and should get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 I pushed_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the button that sent_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) a signal requesting_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the bus to stop_(ScrEv_bus_stops) at the next bus top .
 The bus pulled_(ScrEv_bus_stops) over_(ScrEv_bus_stops) at the next stop and I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus .
 I met_(UnrelEv) my friend a few blocks down at a restaurant and had_(UnrelEv) a great time .

 Today I rode_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) to work as I usually do_(Evoking) .
 Because I ride_(Evoking) several_(Evoking) busses_(Evoking) daily , I had previously purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a bus pass that allows_(UnrelEv) unlimited_(UnrelEv) use for the month .
 By having_(RelNScrEv) this pass I did n't need to worry_(UnrelEv) about having_(UnrelEv) proper change or tokens for the bus .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the schedule for my bus by using_(UnrelEv) '' `` Google Maps '' '' and determined_(ScrEv_check_time-table) that my regular bus was_(RelNScrEv) on schedule .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop and saw_(UnrelEv) that my bus was_(UnrelEv) several blocks away .
 When the bus arrived_(ScrEv_bus_comes) I boarded_(ScrEv_board_bus) it after several other passengers , and then slid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my pass through the card reader .
 There were_(UnrelEv) several seats available and I selected_(ScrEv_find_place) the first one I came_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) .
 The bus continued_(ScrEv_ride) on schedule along the route with passengers departing_(ScrEv_get_off) and boarding_(ScrEv_board_bus) .

 Then I called_(RelNScrEv) the bus hotline and asked_(RelNScrEv) the operator how to get_(RelNScrEv) where I wanted_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) .
 He helped_(UnrelEv) me figure_(ScrEv_check_time-table) out_(ScrEv_check_time-table) what buses I need to take_(RelNScrEv) where .
 Then , I had_(UnrelEv) some lunch , took_(RelNScrEv) my backpack and left_(RelNScrEv) the house .
 I had to walk_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop .
 On the way , I could smell_(UnrelEv) the exhaust from the cars and I already started_(UnrelEv) freaking_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) .
 The exhaust is_(UnrelEv) really unhealthy for you .
 Then I waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus at the stop .
 After 20 minutes , the bus I needed_(UnrelEv) finally came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 The bus came_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to stop , the doors opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) .
 I stepped_(ScrEv_board_bus) onto the bus and gave_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the driver my money .

 This past weekend I rode_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 I was_(UnrelEv) in a busy city and needed to get_(RelNScrEv) to a tour bus .
 After getting_(UnrelEv) of the train system I was directed_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the city bus .
 I noticed_(UnrelEv) a section of the block where a lot of people were standing_(RelNScrEv) around and the bus would stop_(ScrEv_bus_stops) in this area to put_(ScrEv_board_bus) up passengers .
 There was_(UnrelEv) but after bus after bus and you had to move_(UnrelEv) fast .
 I was told_(UnrelEv) that number 77 was_(UnrelEv) my bus .
 So when I saw_(UnrelEv) it pull_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up I had to push_(ScrEv_other) through the crowd so that I could board_(ScrEv_board_bus) my bus .
 I was able to get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on and the bus captain came_(RelNScrEv) over to me after a minute or so and collected_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my fair .
 As I sat_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) back to relaxed_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) I noticed_(UnrelEv) that the bus driver was driving_(RelNScrEv) the bus with wild abandon .
 He was_(UnrelEv) flying_(UnrelEv) through the street and than squealing_(RelNScrEv) the brakes as he tried_(UnrelEv) to keep_(RelNScrEv) control of the vehicle .
 I just knew_(UnrelEv) we were all going to die_(UnrelEv) .
 I was trying_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) my friends attention but she was_(UnrelEv) turned_(UnrelEv) around and deep in a conversation .
 This was_(UnrelEv) a nerve racking situation not only because of his driving_(RelNScrEv) but I did n't really know_(UnrelEv) my stop so I was tried_(UnrelEv) to calm_(UnrelEv) my heart as we nearly missed_(UnrelEv) car after car and look_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) our the window to determine_(UnrelEv) where the tour bus company was located_(UnrelEv) .

 There is_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) stop_(Evoking) down the street from my house .
 If you take_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) going_(RelNScrEv) south , it leads_(RelNScrEv) to the city , and if you take_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) going_(RelNScrEv) north , it leads_(RelNScrEv) to the next suburban town .
 I needed_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) to the city , so I went_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop and waited_(ScrEv_wait) .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) about ten minutes and then the bus came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 It wheezed_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to a stop near me and then the door opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) .
 I walked_(ScrEv_board_bus) into the bus and up the short flight of stairs toward the driver .
 I had_(UnrelEv) just enough change on me to pay_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the fare .
 I fed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my coins into the slot where you put_(UnrelEv) your money and then walked_(ScrEv_other) to the left and down the aisle to find_(ScrEv_find_place) my seat .
 I passed_(RelNScrEv) the front seats , which are intended_(UnrelEv) for older or handicapped passengers , and took_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat about halfway down the bus , next to the window .
 The bus ride lasted_(RelNScrEv) 15 minutes .
 When I saw_(UnrelEv) that my stop would be_(RelNScrEv) next , I pulled_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the yellow cord that runs_(UnrelEv) along the side of the bus .
 That makes_(RelNScrEv) a beep and signals_(RelNScrEv) the driver that someone wants_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) off the bus .
 The beep sounded_(ScrEv_other) and the bus driver pulled_(ScrEv_bus_stops) over to the side of the road at the next bus stop .
 The doors opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) .
 I got_(ScrEv_other) up and went_(ScrEv_other) to the rear door of the bus , walked_(ScrEv_get_off) down the stairs , and walked_(ScrEv_get_off) out onto the sidewalk .

 Yesterday I had to go_(RelNScrEv) across town to the library to return_(UnrelEv) some books .
 All my friends were_(UnrelEv) busy and my car was_(UnrelEv) in for repairs , so I had to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 First thing was to see_(ScrEv_find_bus) what bus I needed_(UnrelEv) .
 I went_(UnrelEv) over to my computer and pulled_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) the bus schedules for my city .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) the nearest bus stop and checked_(ScrEv_find_bus) the bus lines that stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) there , then looked_(RelNScrEv) for the stop nearest the library .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a bus that went_(RelNScrEv) to both stops , so I would n't have to change_(ScrEv_change_bus) buses to get_(RelNScrEv) there .
 Next I found_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the next time the bus would be_(UnrelEv) at the stop near my house , which was_(UnrelEv) only 15 minutes from now .
 I grabbed_(UnrelEv) the books and headed_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) out to walk_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus to arrive_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) only 2 minutes late , which is_(UnrelEv) n't too bad .
 I climbed_(ScrEv_board_bus) into the bus , paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the driver and found_(ScrEv_find_place) an empty seat .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a pretty nice day , so I just sat_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) there looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_bus) out the window until we got_(ScrEv_bus_stops) to the stop by the library .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus and went_(UnrelEv) inside to return_(UnrelEv) my books .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all .

 Needing to go_(UnrelEv) across town , I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) rather than drive_(UnrelEv) .
 I had_(UnrelEv) no bus tokens to pay_(RelNScrEv) for the fare so I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus station downtown and bought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) some .
 Then I got_(ScrEv_other) a bus schedule and looked_(ScrEv_other) for a bus that was going_(RelNScrEv) across town .
 I would be riding_(RelNScrEv) bus number 6 .
 So I went_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) out to the platform where a lot of other people were waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for their buses .
 I found_(UnrelEv) where number 6 stopped and got_(ScrEv_other) in the line .
 When the bus came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) I had_(UnrelEv) my token out and ready to deposit_(RelNScrEv) in the fare collection box .
 Then I went_(UnrelEv) and found_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat .
 I was going to sit_(ScrEv_find_place) next to a woman that looked_(UnrelEv) like she was going_(UnrelEv) to work .
 The bus meandered_(RelNScrEv) through the city and finally got_(RelNScrEv) me to my destination .

 Yesterday we got_(UnrelEv) to ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) downtown to the Fisherman 's Wharf .
 Before we left_(UnrelEv) , we checked_(ScrEv_other) the schedule to see_(UnrelEv) what bus we should_(UnrelEv) take_(RelNScrEv) and what time it would pick_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up .
 10 minutes before the bus was scheduled_(RelNScrEv) to pick_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up in our area , we walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the street corner and stopped_(UnrelEv) in front of the '' `` Bus Stop '' '' sign .

 I was going to meet_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) with my friends at the mall to watch_(UnrelEv) a new movie that recently came_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) .
 But , since the mall is_(UnrelEv) pretty far away , I needed to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 So , I went_(RelNScrEv) online_(RelNScrEv) to the bus ' site to check_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the time that the Mall Route bus would be_(UnrelEv) near my house .
 I marked_(RelNScrEv) the times down on my phone and got_(UnrelEv) ready_(UnrelEv) to leave_(UnrelEv) .
 I sent_(UnrelEv) a text to my friends and let_(UnrelEv) them know_(UnrelEv) that I could make_(UnrelEv) it and that I 'd been_(UnrelEv) there soon .
 I grabbed_(UnrelEv) my jacket , wallet , and made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my bus pass .
 I checked_(UnrelEv) the time and set_(UnrelEv) off_(UnrelEv) .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) a few blocks to the bus stop and double checked_(UnrelEv) the time .
 I had to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for a little bit , but it 's_(UnrelEv) always better to get_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the stop early , since sometimes the bus is_(UnrelEv) n't quite on schedule .
 The bus finally pulled_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up_(ScrEv_bus_comes) and I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) .
 I swiped_(RelNScrEv) my card and I found_(ScrEv_find_place) a decent seat .
 Luckily , there were_(UnrelEv) n't that many people on board and the stops were_(UnrelEv) short .
 As the bus got_(ScrEv_ride) closer to the mall , and it was nearing_(RelNScrEv) the stop , I pulled_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) on the line that let_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) the driver know_(ScrEv_press_stop_button) that she needed to let_(ScrEv_get_off) someone off .
 I made_(RelNScrEv) it to the mall in good time and got to hang_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) with my friends a bit before the movie .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a pretty good day .

 After touring_(UnrelEv) the city , I arrived_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) at the public bus stop and took_(RelNScrEv) a seat on the bench waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus to arrive_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 I looked_(ScrEv_check_time-table) at_(ScrEv_check_time-table) a map on what this bus 's route was_(UnrelEv) , and it was heading_(ScrEv_ride) towards where I needed to go_(RelNScrEv) .
 Since I am easily bored_(UnrelEv) , I brought_(UnrelEv) my MP3 player with me to listen_(RelNScrEv) to_(RelNScrEv) music .
 After a 10 minute wait the bus arrived_(ScrEv_bus_comes) and I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) with another person .
 As I walked_(ScrEv_board_bus) up_(ScrEv_board_bus) on the bus , I paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the fee that is required_(RelNScrEv) since I do n't have_(RelNScrEv) a bus pass .
 Since most people in the city like_(UnrelEv) to keep_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) themselves , I left_(UnrelEv) them alone and found_(ScrEv_find_place) an open seat on the bus in the back .
 After about 20 minutes on the bus , they finally arrived_(ScrEv_bus_stops) at_(ScrEv_bus_stops) my destination spot and I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 After getting_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus , I walked_(UnrelEv) a couple more blocks over to where my hotel was_(UnrelEv) .

 I live_(UnrelEv) near Blacksburg , Virginia and often stay_(UnrelEv) with friends who live_(UnrelEv) near Virginia Tech .
 A bus_(Evoking) route_(Evoking) stops_(UnrelEv) at their apartment complex and we often ride_(ScrEv_ride) it downtown to eat_(UnrelEv) brunch after a late night .
 Nothing unusual ever happens_(UnrelEv) .
 We get_(UnrelEv) ready and go_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the bus stop .
 There 's_(UnrelEv) a bench and it 's_(UnrelEv) covered_(UnrelEv) but there 's_(UnrelEv) no doors .
 The bus is_(ScrEv_bus_comes) always on time and we hop_(ScrEv_board_bus) on .
 It 's_(RelNScrEv) never crowded_(UnrelEv) so we can_(UnrelEv) always find_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat .
 The varying bus drivers are_(RelNScrEv) nice and we hop_(ScrEv_board_bus) on , pay_(ScrEv_get_ticket) , and take_(ScrEv_find_place) our seats .
 The ride downtown takes_(RelNScrEv) about 10 minutes because of other stops .
 No other passengers ever talk_(UnrelEv) to each other and honestly groups of friends from different races stick_(UnrelEv) together .
 Being_(UnrelEv) near a college such as Virginia Tech makes_(UnrelEv) for a very diverse area where different cultures intermingle_(UnrelEv) but the bus seems_(UnrelEv) to have_(RelNScrEv) the most obviously segregated_(UnrelEv) groups .
 We get_(ScrEv_ride) to our stop and enjoy_(UnrelEv) brunch .
 I like_(UnrelEv) riding_(ScrEv_ride) the bus because of the convenience factor , no parking_(UnrelEv) , and it feels_(UnrelEv) like we are doing_(UnrelEv) something to help_(UnrelEv) the environment .

 Last Friday , my car broke_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) .
 I had to get_(RelNScrEv) to work Monday , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) since it ran_(RelNScrEv) fairly close to my home and work both .
 Monday morning I got_(RelNScrEv) ready_(RelNScrEv) early and set_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) off_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to wait_(ScrEv_wait) at the bus stop .
 After sitting_(ScrEv_wait) for quite a while , the bus finally pulled_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 I let others at the stop get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) first , then I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) .
 I asked_(RelNScrEv) the bus driver how much the fare was_(UnrelEv) and he told_(RelNScrEv) me .
 I paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the fare by sticking_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my money in the box near the bus driver , and walked_(ScrEv_find_place) to find_(ScrEv_find_place) a free seat .
 I found_(ScrEv_find_place) one near the back of the bus , and I sat_(ScrEv_find_place) down_(ScrEv_find_place) .
 The bus ride was_(UnrelEv) fairly quick and uneventful .
 I noted_(UnrelEv) that the ride went_(ScrEv_ride) the same route that I did .

 My car was_(UnrelEv) in the shop , so today I decided_(UnrelEv) to commute_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) school_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) .
 First , I looked_(ScrEv_check_time-table) up_(ScrEv_check_time-table) what bus I would need_(UnrelEv) .
 I found_(UnrelEv) I need to take_(Evoking) two_(Evoking) buses_(Evoking) and transfer_(ScrEv_change_bus) in the middle .
 I started_(UnrelEv) walking_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) to the first bus stop and arrived_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) ten minutes before the bus was scheduled_(ScrEv_check_time-table) to arrive_(ScrEv_bus_comes) .
 It came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) on time , and the bus driver let_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the other passengers .
 I stepped_(ScrEv_board_bus) onto_(ScrEv_board_bus) the bus and paid_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the driver the fare .
 Then I found_(ScrEv_find_place) an open seat by a window and sat_(ScrEv_find_place) down_(ScrEv_find_place) .
 The ride was_(UnrelEv) around 15 minutes or so .
 Then the driver announced_(ScrEv_bus_stops) my stop .
 I headed_(ScrEv_get_off) out_(ScrEv_get_off) the back doors .
 Outside , I found_(UnrelEv) a bench and sat_(ScrEv_wait) down_(ScrEv_wait) .
 The next bus came_(ScrEv_bus_comes) fairly quickly .
 I hopped_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) and showed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the driver my transfer ticket .
 This time , the bus was packed_(RelNScrEv) , so I found_(ScrEv_find_place) a pole and hung_(ScrEv_find_place) on_(ScrEv_find_place) .
 The ride was_(UnrelEv) n't too long , however , and soon I was_(ScrEv_bus_stops) at_(ScrEv_bus_stops) my final destination .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_off) my_(ScrEv_get_off) way_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus and walked_(UnrelEv) over_(UnrelEv) to school .

 The other day I decided_(UnrelEv) not to drive_(UnrelEv) into the city like I usually do_(UnrelEv) , but to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) instead .
 Even though it is_(UnrelEv) a ten minute walk from my house to the bus stop , it is_(UnrelEv) still much more relaxing_(UnrelEv) to travel_(Evoking) by_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) bus_(Evoking) instead of getting_(UnrelEv) stressed_(UnrelEv) driving_(UnrelEv) in traffic in the city .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_bus_stop) in the sunshine to the bus stop where lots of other people were already waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for the bus , some of them were reading_(RelNScrEv) the bus timetable attached_(UnrelEv) to the covered_(UnrelEv) bus stop .
 There was_(UnrelEv) no space on the bench so I just stood_(ScrEv_other) in line and waited_(ScrEv_wait) until I saw_(UnrelEv) the big red double decker bus turn_(ScrEv_bus_comes) the corner and head_(ScrEv_bus_comes) towards us .
 When the driver pulled_(ScrEv_bus_comes) up at the curb , people started_(UnrelEv) to board_(ScrEv_board_bus) the bus , it took_(UnrelEv) a while as each of them had to stop_(UnrelEv) to pay_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the driver before finding_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat but eventually it was_(UnrelEv) my turn to get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on board .
 I told_(RelNScrEv) the driver where I wanted_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off the bus and that I needed_(RelNScrEv) a return fare as I wanted_(UnrelEv) to come_(UnrelEv) home later .
 I found_(UnrelEv) the correct change to hand_(ScrEv_get_ticket) to the driver and he punched_(RelNScrEv) some buttons on a machine at the side of the steering wheel .
 The machine printed_(RelNScrEv) a ticket which he gave_(ScrEv_get_ticket) to me and said_(UnrelEv) I would have to keep_(UnrelEv) safe to hand_(RelNScrEv) in on the return bus journey .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to sit_(UnrelEv) upstairs as the view of the countryside is always better from higher up , and climbed_(ScrEv_other) the little spiral staircase up to the top deck where I found_(ScrEv_find_place) an empty seat .
 The journey was_(UnrelEv) noisy , lots of people were talking_(UnrelEv) and laughing_(UnrelEv) and it took_(RelNScrEv) a lot longer than if I was driving_(UnrelEv) as the bus stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) in various villages along the way .
 By the time I got_(ScrEv_other) to the city and left_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus , I was_(UnrelEv) relaxed and happy and looking_(UnrelEv) forward to doing_(UnrelEv) some shopping_(UnrelEv) .

 I did n't get_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) it , however , because it was_(UnrelEv) the 90 bus .
 I know that I need to take_(Unclear) the 87 or 88 to get_(RelNScrEv) to the grocery store .
 Finally an 87 bus stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) , and I got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) , tapping_(RelNScrEv) my bus pass onto a special box near the door .

 We stopped_(ScrEv_bus_stops) a couple of times at Lexington Road and then Drove Street .
 Sometimes people got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the bus , and sometimes people got_(ScrEv_board_bus) on_(ScrEv_board_bus) .

 I felt_(UnrelEv) bad for him , so I said_(UnrelEv) I would at least bake_(Evoking) him_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 Maybe this was_(UnrelEv) a hasty decision since I have_(UnrelEv) no experience baking_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) .
 So I looked_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) online to see_(UnrelEv) what I needed to do_(UnrelEv) .
 I found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe that looked_(UnrelEv) easy enough , so later that day I drove_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) over to the grocery store to buy_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all the ingredients I would need_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 When I got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) to_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the store I started gathering_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) up everything I needed .
 Once I almost had_(UnrelEv) everything I turned_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) an aisle and noticed_(UnrelEv) there were_(UnrelEv) boxed of pre-made_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) cake mix I could buy_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) .
 This seemed_(UnrelEv) like an easy option , so I put_(UnrelEv) all the ingredients back and bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) one of those mixes .
 I got_(RelNScrEv) home and started_(UnrelEv) baking_(Evoking) .
 All I needed to add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) to the mix was a couple eggs and some vegetable oil .
 After it was_(ScrEv_wait) in the oven for an hour the cake was_(UnrelEv) ready .

 He has_(UnrelEv) very simple tastes , and likes_(UnrelEv) white vanilla cake with butter cream frosting .

 However , I decided_(UnrelEv) to make_(UnrelEv) baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) a family activity , and hope we could have_(UnrelEv) some fun doing_(UnrelEv) so .
 I quickly looked_(RelNScrEv) in the cupboards , and realized_(UnrelEv) that I had_(RelNScrEv) enough ingredients to bake_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the mixing bowls , and the kids helped_(UnrelEv) with the cracking_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) of the eggs , and the mixing_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) the anticipation of the cake was_(UnrelEv) heavy on their minds , as it had been_(UnrelEv) a while since I baked_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 Once the mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) was done_(UnrelEv) , I turn_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven on to preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) , and moved_(RelNScrEv) the kids to the island for safety .
 They took_(UnrelEv) turns pouring_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake batter into the pan , and then I placed_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake into the oven .
 The hard part is_(UnrelEv) now waiting_(ScrEv_wait) , and I hate_(UnrelEv) to wait_(ScrEv_wait) , however , this cake was_(UnrelEv) worth waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for .
 As a treat , I allowed_(UnrelEv) the kids to eat_(ScrEv_eat) a tiny piece of the cake , as a thank you gesture for all their help .

 I was watching_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a cooking show yesterday on television about different recipes for cake mix cakes .
 I saw_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe that looked good .
 I had_(UnrelEv) a Red Velvet chocolate cake mix in a box and the blueberries required_(UnrelEv) .
 I 'm_(UnrelEv) too adventurous for my own good .
 I figured_(UnrelEv) I 'd try_(UnrelEv) it .
 I tossed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the blueberries with sugar and put_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) them in the baking dish .
 I then mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) butter and a little milk with the cake mix .
 I put_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it on top of the blueberries .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it in the oven .
 It was supposed_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) like a cobbler .
 The cake was_(UnrelEv) pretty bad .
 The bottom was_(UnrelEv) all watery and the cake mix was_(UnrelEv) super mushy because of all the liquid .
 The first couple of bites were_(UnrelEv) okay .
 That was_(UnrelEv) about all anyone could eat_(ScrEv_eat) .
 I even tried_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) the juice out .
 I 'm tossing_(UnrelEv) it this morning .

 I was invited_(UnrelEv) to my friend 's housewarming_(UnrelEv) party this weekend and although we were n't asked_(UnrelEv) to bring_(UnrelEv) anything I wanted_(UnrelEv) to bring_(RelNScrEv) something .
 Knowing_(UnrelEv) that my friend loves_(UnrelEv) chocolate cake I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) her_(Evoking) one_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_other) to the kitchen and grabbed_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a large bowl , a whisk , a cake pan , and the ingredients for the cake .

 My girlfriend 's birthday was coming_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) and instead of my usual buying_(UnrelEv) a cake from the grocery store every year , I thought_(UnrelEv) I would unleash_(UnrelEv) my inner Paula Dean and bake_(Evoking) her_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) to the store and bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) an easy yellow cake mix , some eggs , butter and icing .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to do it this way because when it comes_(UnrelEv) to me and cooking_(Evoking) I am_(UnrelEv) not the best so easy was_(UnrelEv) the way to go .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) home and got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) out_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a mixing bowl and added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the cake box mix , two eggs , a stick of butter and a cup of water .
 I mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) it up and then poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into a large baking pan and licked_(UnrelEv) the beaters .
 I baked_(ScrEv_wait) it at 350 for 15 minutes and it came_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) out_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) a perfect golden brown .
 After letting it cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) for a bit I put_(ScrEv_decorate) on_(ScrEv_decorate) the chocolate icing that I bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) and needless to say the cake was_(UnrelEv) a huge hit and she was_(UnrelEv) very impressed with my baking skills .

 I bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) flour , sugar , eggs , and some cocoa .
 All the other ingredients I had_(UnrelEv) at home already .

 My boyfriend 's birthday was_(UnrelEv) just around the corner so I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) two-layer_(Evoking) Strawberry_(Evoking) Cake_(Evoking) for him .
 To bake_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) , I needed_(RelNScrEv) sugar , milk , strawberry jello , vanilla extract , cake flour , butter , and strawberry puree .
 For the icing , I needed_(RelNScrEv) cream cheese , confectioner 's sugar , butter , and fresh strawberries .
 While the oven preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) , I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) all of the dry ingredients in one bowl and all of the wet ingredients into another bowl .
 I then added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stirred_(ScrEv_other) until everything was mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) well together .
 Once this was done_(UnrelEv) , I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into two separate round cake pans and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the pans in the oven to bake_(RelNScrEv) for about 20 minutes .
 After I took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the finished cakes out and placed_(ScrEv_other) them on wire racks to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) for about 10 minutes , I went_(UnrelEv) ahead and made_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the frosting .
 Using_(UnrelEv) an electric mixer , I beat_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the cream cheese and butter until they were_(UnrelEv) creamy and then beat_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in the sugar and fresh strawberries until I got_(UnrelEv) the smooth consistency that I wanted_(UnrelEv) .
 Lastly , I assembled_(ScrEv_other) the cake by frosting_(ScrEv_decorate) the first layer then adding_(ScrEv_other) the second layer and frosting_(ScrEv_decorate) that as well .
 I also garnished_(ScrEv_decorate) the finished cake with some leftover strawberries I had_(UnrelEv) .
 My boyfriend loved_(UnrelEv) the cake .

 I love_(UnrelEv) too cook_(Evoking) .
 Cooking_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) far easier than most people think_(UnrelEv) , in fact , I believe_(UnrelEv) that it is_(UnrelEv) often as easy to make_(UnrelEv) good food from scratch as it is_(UnrelEv) to make_(UnrelEv) something from a box , and it tastes_(UnrelEv) a million times better .
 One of the best examples of this is_(UnrelEv) a simple cake .
 A basic yellow cake takes_(UnrelEv) only a few ingredients ; flour , sugar , eggs milk , baking powder , salt , vanilla , and water .
 Once a person sifts_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the dry ingredients together it is_(UnrelEv) the same a making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) box_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) mix_(Evoking) .
 The time and directions are_(UnrelEv) nearly identical , but the result is_(UnrelEv) much cheaper and more delicious than anything out of a box .
 While the cake is baking_(ScrEv_wait) it is_(UnrelEv) wise to make_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) a good frosting for the cake , once someone has_(UnrelEv) home made frosting , the stuff in a can tastes_(UnrelEv) only like chemicals .
 Frosting is even easier than the cake to prepare_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) , Vanilla butter cream frosting the just ; powdered sugar , vanilla , butter and milk .
 When mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) in the correct proportions and whipped_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) up_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) this is_(UnrelEv) the perfect topping for any cake , and with food coloring is_(UnrelEv) an excellent medium for any decorated cakes , because any color will take_(UnrelEv) easily to the stark white base .
 Once the cake is baked_(Unclear) it is_(UnrelEv) important to watch_(RelNScrEv) it , to be sure it cools_(ScrEv_cool_down) enough before removing_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it from the pan to frost_(ScrEv_decorate) .
 A cake plate -LRB- the kind on a small pedestal -RRB- is_(UnrelEv) the perfect thing to make guests fawn_(UnrelEv) over this quick and easy dessert .

 I love_(UnrelEv) to make_(Evoking) cheesecake_(Evoking) for my family .
 We have_(UnrelEv) a family recipe that I follow_(UnrelEv) when I cook_(Evoking) .
 First I purchase_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the ingredients at the store and make_(RelNScrEv) certain_(RelNScrEv) I have everything I need_(UnrelEv) .
 Then I make_(UnrelEv) a crust from scratch in a cake pan , using_(UnrelEv) crumbled cookies , nuts , brown sugar and vanilla flavor .
 I turn_(ScrEv_preheat) on_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to pre-heat_(ScrEv_preheat) , as my oven is very slow to heat_(ScrEv_preheat) up_(ScrEv_preheat) .
 I use_(UnrelEv) my electric mixer to whip_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the pats of cream cheese , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) they are light and fluffy .
 Then I add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in eggs , sugar , lemon juice and lemon zest until it is thoroughly combined_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) into a thick liquid .
 I pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the mixture into the prepared_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) cake pan and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it into the preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) oven for about 45 minutes .
 When the cake is_(UnrelEv) slightly brown on top , I remove_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it from the oven and place_(RelNScrEv) it in the refrigerator to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 This usually takes_(ScrEv_wait) about two hours .
 Then it is_(UnrelEv) ready to serve_(ScrEv_eat) .

 She usually make_(UnrelEv) 5-6 cakes for us and for some friends .
 First she prepared_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) caramel syrup to give_(UnrelEv) the cake that dark color .

 We need_(UnrelEv) lots of eggs for preparing_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the cake .
 I helped_(UnrelEv) her in beating_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the egg white for cake .
 After mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) every contents well , she poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the mix into the baking pans and kept_(ScrEv_wait) it in to the oven and set_(ScrEv_set_time) temperature and time to get it done .

 I have_(UnrelEv) a recipe for a yellow layer cake that I really like_(UnrelEv) that came_(UnrelEv) in my Kitchenaid cookbook .
 I use_(UnrelEv) my Kitchenaid mixer to make_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) not too dry , and it 's_(UnrelEv) not too sweet , which is_(UnrelEv) why I like_(UnrelEv) it .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_utensils) my mixer out of the pantry and set_(ScrEv_get_utensils) it on the counter .
 Then I found_(ScrEv_get_utensils) the right beater for cake and installed_(ScrEv_get_utensils) it .
 I creamed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the butter and the sugar , added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the eggs , and then added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the wet and dry ingredients alternately .
 I had forgotten_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the eggs out earlier to let_(UnrelEv) them come_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) to room temperature , but it still works_(UnrelEv) OK .
 While beating_(ScrEv_make_dough) the cake batter , I preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven .
 Then I took_(ScrEv_get_utensils) out_(ScrEv_get_utensils) two eight-inch round cake pans and buttered_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) them .
 After that , I floured_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the cake pans and tipped_(RelNScrEv) the extra flour into the garbage can .
 When the batter was ready , I stopped_(RelNScrEv) the mixer , removed_(RelNScrEv) the bowl , and poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) half the batter into each pan .
 I just eye-balled_(RelNScrEv) it and did n't measure_(RelNScrEv) exactly half .
 Then I scraped_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the remaining_(UnrelEv) batter out of the bowl and into the pans .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) the bowl in the sink .
 I evened_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) the top of the batter a little with a spatula and tapped_(RelNScrEv) the cake pans on the counter to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) there were_(UnrelEv) no air bubbles .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cakes in the oven and set_(ScrEv_set_time) the timer .
 Then I turned_(RelNScrEv) on_(RelNScrEv) the oven light because I like_(UnrelEv) to keep_(RelNScrEv) an eye on the cakes to see_(UnrelEv) how they 're cooking_(ScrEv_wait) .
 Plus it 's_(UnrelEv) fun to see_(UnrelEv) them rise_(RelNScrEv) .
 When the timer went_(ScrEv_wait) off_(ScrEv_wait) , I stuck_(ScrEv_check) a thin knife blade into each cake to test_(ScrEv_check) whether they were done_(RelNScrEv) .
 No crumbs stuck_(RelNScrEv) to the knife , so I removed_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) the cakes from the pan and set_(ScrEv_cool_down) them on the stove burners to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 After a couple of minutes , I turned_(RelNScrEv) each pan upside-down onto a cooling rack and let_(UnrelEv) the cakes cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) for about an hour .
 Then I tipped_(RelNScrEv) one cake over onto a large plate .
 I made_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) frosting and spread_(ScrEv_decorate) some on this layer .
 Then I tipped_(RelNScrEv) the other layer on top of that one and frosted_(ScrEv_decorate) it too .
 It was_(UnrelEv) vanilla frosting .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for my daughter 's birthday .
 I had gone_(RelNScrEv) to the grocery store to buy_(UnrelEv) one , but nothing looked_(UnrelEv) very good and they were_(UnrelEv) really expensive for what I was getting_(UnrelEv) .
 I figured_(UnrelEv) that I could make_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) better_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) myself .
 I figured_(UnrelEv) that I have seen_(UnrelEv) cooking shows and said_(UnrelEv) , '' `` How hard could it be_(UnrelEv) ? '' ''
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix and I thought_(UnrelEv) it looked_(UnrelEv) pretty good .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to the frosting and found_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) some Oreo frosting mix and thought_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) perfect because my daughter loves_(UnrelEv) Oreo cookies .
 Then , I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a box of Oreo cookies , some eggs , milk , and some oil .
 I did not know_(UnrelEv) if I had_(UnrelEv) all of that at home , but I figured_(UnrelEv) they would not go_(UnrelEv) to waste .
 I came_(ScrEv_other) home and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) everything and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it in the oven .
 I tested_(ScrEv_check) the cake before taking_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it out of the oven with a toothpick .
 Coming_(RelNScrEv) out clean , I decided_(UnrelEv) the cake was done_(RelNScrEv) .
 I had pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake mix into two baking_(RelNScrEv) pans because my plan was_(UnrelEv) to make a two layered_(RelNScrEv) cake .
 I saw on a cooking show that you are supposed_(UnrelEv) to cut_(RelNScrEv) the top of one of the cakes so that the top was_(UnrelEv) flat .
 I managed_(UnrelEv) to do_(ScrEv_other) that pretty well and I ate_(ScrEv_eat) the cake with some milk .
 It was_(UnrelEv) pretty tasty .
 So , next , I got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the frosting and put_(ScrEv_decorate) it on the first layer , and then on the second .
 I thought it looked_(UnrelEv) pretty good .
 I carefully chopped_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) some oreos up and sprinkled_(ScrEv_decorate) them on the top of the cake .
 To further top_(RelNScrEv) it off , I cut_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) a few cookies in half and stuck_(ScrEv_decorate) them pointing_(UnrelEv) up in a circle around the outside of the cake .
 It looked_(UnrelEv) really good .
 My wife was_(UnrelEv) really surprised_(UnrelEv) that I had made_(RelNScrEv) it myself .
 My daughter was_(UnrelEv) really happy and everyone liked_(UnrelEv) the cake .

 It was_(UnrelEv) my friend Riley 's birthday and I wanted_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) something special for her this year .
 I usually buy_(UnrelEv) her a birthday cake but this year I wanted_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) something different .
 I was_(UnrelEv) n't too sure how to make_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) but I decided_(UnrelEv) to try_(RelNScrEv) a recipe I saw_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) in a magazine .
 The day before I had purchased_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all of the ingredients including_(UnrelEv) cake mix , eggs , and strawberries .
 I started_(UnrelEv) off by cracking_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the eggs and putting_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it in a large bowl .
 I mixed_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in sugar and the cake mix according to the instructions .
 The instructions said_(UnrelEv) to bake_(RelNScrEv) the whole mix in the oven for a couple of hours .
 When the cake was_(UnrelEv) ready , I put_(RelNScrEv) on my oven mitts and removed_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it from the oven .
 It looked_(UnrelEv) so good but one thing was missing_(UnrelEv) .
 i went_(UnrelEv) into the refrigerator and pulled_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) out six fresh strawberries and placed_(ScrEv_decorate) them on top .
 Riley will love_(UnrelEv) it !

 Baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) begins_(UnrelEv) with a good recipe that you want_(UnrelEv) to use_(UnrelEv) .
 Follow_(UnrelEv) the recipe to get_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all the ingredients at the store .
 Assuming_(UnrelEv) you have_(UnrelEv) all the ingredients , you will also need to acquire_(ScrEv_get_utensils) all the tools necessary to bake_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 This usually includes_(UnrelEv) measuring cups , mixing bowls , and the actual mixer .
 You will then follow_(UnrelEv) the recipe to measure_(ScrEv_other) out_(ScrEv_other) the ingredients in the exact proportions that the recipe calls_(UnrelEv) for_(UnrelEv) .
 This has to be done_(UnrelEv) very accurately else the cake will not bake_(ScrEv_other) properly .
 Once all the ingredients in the mixing bowl , use_(UnrelEv) the mixer to mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) all the ingredients into a nice batter .

 Next pre-heat_(ScrEv_preheat) the over to the temperature the recipe calls_(UnrelEv) for_(UnrelEv) .

 The simplest way to make_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) with a mix .
 Just open_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the box and mix_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) some eggs , some water , and maybe some oil .
 Grease_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) two round pans by rubbing_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) them with a stick of butter , pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) in_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter , bake_(ScrEv_wait) as directed_(RelNScrEv) and you are done_(UnrelEv) .
 Making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) coffee_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) with Bisquick baking mix is_(UnrelEv) only slightly harder , but the product is_(UnrelEv) not really what some people call_(UnrelEv) a cake .
 There are_(UnrelEv) also delicious cakes that are_(UnrelEv) really store-bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) baked_(ScrEv_wait) goods layered_(ScrEv_decorate) with ice cream .
 But for a birthday , an actual homemade_(RelNScrEv) cake is_(UnrelEv) traditional .
 I make_(Evoking) such_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) in two separate bowls and then combine_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the mixtures .
 I also use_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a stand mixer , though even that can feel_(UnrelEv) like cheating_(UnrelEv) .
 First , I lay_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) out_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all my ingredients , and preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven .
 I prepare_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) two round pans , by greasing_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) with butter or pan spray , sprinkling_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) with flour and shaking_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) out_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the excess .
 Next , I cream_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the butter and sugar together , on a medium-high mixer setting .
 Then I mix_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) eggs and then vanilla .
 In a separate bowl , I combine_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the flour , baking powder , and salt .
 Now , I add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the dry ingredients to the butter mixture , a little at a time , alternating_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) with the milk , while I mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) at medium high .
 It is_(UnrelEv) important not to over mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) , so I only combine_(ScrEv_make_dough) until the lumps are gone_(UnrelEv) and it looks_(UnrelEv) glossy .
 I fill_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the pans evenly , and place_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) in the oven so they do not touch_(UnrelEv) and one is_(UnrelEv) not directly above the other .
 When the time is_(ScrEv_wait) up_(ScrEv_wait) , or they smell_(RelNScrEv) done_(ScrEv_wait) , I press_(ScrEv_check) lightly in the center of the cake with one finger .
 If it springs_(ScrEv_check) back_(ScrEv_check) it is done_(ScrEv_wait) .
 I cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) on a wire rack , run_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) a knife around the edge , invert_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it on a plate to remove_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) while still warm .
 I frost_(ScrEv_decorate) liberally , and I do n't forget_(ScrEv_decorate) the candles .

 My friends birthday was_(UnrelEv) tomorrow and I wanted_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) something special for her .
 Aside from just getting_(UnrelEv) her a gift I decided_(UnrelEv) to make_(Evoking) her_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) special_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 This cake was going to be_(UnrelEv) shaped like a heart and it would be_(UnrelEv) chocolate , her favorite flavor .
 I headed_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) to the grocery store to get_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) my ingredients .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) butter , unsweetened chocolate , sugar , eggs , flour , baking soda , salt , milk , and vinegar .
 I was making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) devil_(Evoking) 's_(Evoking) food_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) , something simple and yet elegant .
 When I got_(RelNScrEv) home I preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to 350 degrees F and I grease_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) up_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) my pans , I was going to be working_(UnrelEv) hard tonight .
 I then melted_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) 1\/2 cup of butter and 1 ounce of chocolate in a small pan , once it had melted_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) I set it aside to cool_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) down_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) .
 So far so good .
 Next I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) 2 eggs with 2 cups of white sugar and I added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the chocolate mixture .
 After that I added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) 1 cup of boiled water and I made sure to blend_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) it well , the mixture was_(UnrelEv) very liquid like , just like it needed to be_(UnrelEv) .
 After that I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) in my 2 1/4 cups of flour , 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda , and 1/4 teaspoons of salt .
 I blended_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) this new mixture well .
 I am_(UnrelEv) really the best boyfriend in the world .
 After that I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) in 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 1\/4 cup of milk to the main mixture .
 The main process was done_(UnrelEv) all I needed_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) was to bake_(ScrEv_wait) it for 30 minutes , cut_(ScrEv_decorate) it into shape , and frost_(ScrEv_decorate) the cake .
 Her birthday tomorrow was going to be_(UnrelEv) very special .

 Every Sunday , I love_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for a family dessert .
 But before I bake_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) , I make_(UnrelEv) sure I go_(RelNScrEv) to the supermarket to get_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all of my ingredients .
 My ingredients include_(UnrelEv) baking powder , milk , eggs , sugar , and the list continues .
 Once I purchase_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all of my ingredients , I go_(ScrEv_other) home and get_(ScrEv_get_utensils) my electric appliances such as mixer and other tools ready to use_(RelNScrEv) .
 Now , I 'm_(UnrelEv) ready_(UnrelEv) to finally bake_(RelNScrEv) !
 It 's_(UnrelEv) usually very fun to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) because I bake_(RelNScrEv) with my sister .
 We always make_(RelNScrEv) a mess in the kitchen and always laugh_(UnrelEv) about it .
 Whether it 's_(UnrelEv) baking powder all over our clothes , or broken eggs on the floor , we make_(RelNScrEv) a big mess .
 But at the end , we get_(RelNScrEv) everything right and actually bake_(RelNScrEv) a decent cake .
 We tend_(UnrelEv) to bake_(RelNScrEv) vanilla or red velvet cake .
 That 's_(UnrelEv) our favorite .
 Once the cake is_(UnrelEv) ready , we wait_(ScrEv_wait) an hour until we put_(ScrEv_decorate) icing on top of the cake .
 Later on after dinner , the family enjoys_(ScrEv_eat) a nice slice of cake .

 I like_(UnrelEv) to cook_(UnrelEv) a lot but I am_(UnrelEv) not a very good baker .
 So I never bake_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) from scratch .
 However I do like_(UnrelEv) cake al ot so I do bake_(Evoking) them .
 I use_(RelNScrEv) box mixes .
 They are_(UnrelEv) easy to use_(RelNScrEv) and make_(RelNScrEv) a very nice cake .
 it really does n't take_(UnrelEv) much time .
 All you need to do_(UnrelEv) is_(UnrelEv) get_(ScrEv_get_utensils) one bowl .
 Add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the cake mix from the box .
 Either 2 or 3 eggs added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) to the bowl .
 Then a half cup of oil and finally about a cup of water .
 Then you need to get_(ScrEv_get_utensils) your mixer and put_(RelNScrEv) it on medium and mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) it all up for 2 to 3 minutes .
 Then put_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it into a non stick cake pan and bake_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) for about 30 minutes .
 So all together about 10 minutes preparation and 30 minutes baking_(ScrEv_wait) you can have_(UnrelEv) a good tasting_(ScrEv_eat) cake in 40 minutes .
 .
 I do n't really like_(UnrelEv) frosting so as soon as it cools_(ScrEv_cool_down) I cut_(RelNScrEv) myself a slice .

 Just the other day I baked_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe online for a chocolate cake that I really wanted to try_(UnrelEv) , so I went_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) to the store and bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all the ingredients .
 Then I went_(RelNScrEv) home and put_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) everything out onto the counter , including_(UnrelEv) my mixing bowls , measuring cups , and baking dish .
 The first thing I did_(UnrelEv) was to mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the flour , water , sugar , butter , eggs and chocolate together in my big mixing bowl .
 I then greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) up my baking dish with oil , so the cake would n't stick_(UnrelEv) to it while it was baking_(ScrEv_wait) .
 Then I set_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven temperature to 350 degrees and let it preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) .
 After all my ingredients were_(UnrelEv) in the bowl , I used_(UnrelEv) a big spoon to stir_(ScrEv_make_dough) everything together until it was nice and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) up_(ScrEv_make_dough) .
 Then I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into my baking dish , and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it into the oven .
 I let it bake_(ScrEv_wait) for an hour , then took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) out_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake and let it cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 After it was_(UnrelEv) cool I put_(ScrEv_decorate) icing on it , and cut_(ScrEv_eat) it into pieces to save_(UnrelEv) for later .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for my brother 's birthday .
 He likes_(UnrelEv) chocolate cake the best so I chose_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a box of double fudge cake for him .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a cake mix in a box because that 's_(UnrelEv) the easiest way to back_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 The back of the box said_(UnrelEv) to preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven so I did_(ScrEv_preheat) and then I took_(Unclear) out_(Unclear) a bowl , a mixer , milk , eggs and oil .
 I opened_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the cake box and poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the cake mix into the bowl .
 Then I added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) two eggs and the amount of milk and oil the back of the box said_(UnrelEv) to use_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) .
 Next I used_(UnrelEv) the mixer to stir_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) it all together .
 After that I used_(UnrelEv) a little more oil to grease_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) a cake pan .
 The back of the box also told_(UnrelEv) me which size cake pan to use_(RelNScrEv) .
 Once the cake pan was_(UnrelEv) ready , I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) cake batter into it and smoothed_(RelNScrEv) it into the edges then opened_(RelNScrEv) the oven to put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it inside .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) an oven mitt on my hand for that part because the oven was_(UnrelEv) hot .
 Once the door was closed_(RelNScrEv) again , I set_(ScrEv_set_time) a timer to the right amount of time , according to the back of the box , and then waited_(ScrEv_wait) .
 By the time the timer went_(ScrEv_wait) off_(ScrEv_wait) , the cake smelled_(RelNScrEv) really good and I turned_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) off_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) the oven , then opened_(RelNScrEv) it and took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake out with oven mitts again .
 Then I let_(UnrelEv) it cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) on a rack on the counter .
 When it was_(ScrEv_cool_down) cool I opened_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) a container of fudge frosting and spread_(ScrEv_decorate) it all over the cake .
 I just need to put_(ScrEv_decorate) candles on it and I think_(UnrelEv) my brother will really like_(UnrelEv) it .

 I wanted_(UnrelEv) to make_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) chocolate_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for my niece 's birthday , so I looked_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) through_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) my kitchen cupboards to make_(RelNScrEv) sure I had_(RelNScrEv) all the ingredients .
 Luckily , my kitchen was_(UnrelEv) well-stocked_(RelNScrEv) with baking goods .
 I gathered_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) up_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the butter , eggs , sugar , flour , vanilla extract and cocoa .
 I also had_(RelNScrEv) a mixing bowl with a built-in electric whisk .
 I tossed_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) two sticks of butter and 2 cups of sugar and blended_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) them together before adding_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the vanilla , flour and cocoa .
 Then I pulled_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a cake pan out of a drawer and greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) it up with Crisco to make_(UnrelEv) sure the cake would not stick_(RelNScrEv) .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) a spatula to spread_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake batter evenly into the dish and then , just to make_(UnrelEv) the cake even tastier , I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) two cups of chocolate pudding out of my fridge and swirled_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the pudding into the cake mix .
 It makes_(UnrelEv) for a very moist and tasty treat !
 I placed_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake inside the oven and cooked_(ScrEv_wait) it at 350 degrees for 45 minute .
 Hopefully my niece will enjoy_(RelNScrEv) her homemade confection on her birthday .

 The easiest cake_(Evoking) for_(Evoking) me_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) make_(Evoking) is Cheesecake .
 Throw_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) eggs , sugar , cream cheese and flavor in a bowl and you have_(UnrelEv) the filling .
 Pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) that filling in a cookie crust , bake_(RelNScrEv) at 350 for one hour , remove_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) and freeze_(ScrEv_other) .

 I like_(UnrelEv) baking_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) with my granddaughter .
 I let_(UnrelEv) her help_(UnrelEv) pour_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the ingredients and mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) them together .
 I take_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a box of cake mix to her house so we can bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) together .
 We read_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) the directions on the back of the box of cake mix .
 Then we get_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) out_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) everything needed_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) to make_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 We usually need_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) eggs , cooking oil , and water or milk .
 We also need_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a cake pan , a large mixing bowl , a measuring cup , and a mixing spoon .
 Also it helps_(UnrelEv) to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) we have_(ScrEv_get_utensils) pot holders and a spatula .
 I pre-heat_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to the temperature given_(RelNScrEv) in the directions .
 Then I grease_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) or oil_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the cake pan so the cake does not stick_(RelNScrEv) to the pan .
 Usually the directions want_(UnrelEv) me to add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) a little flour to the pan to coat_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the oil , but I like to use_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) sugar instead because it does not leave_(RelNScrEv) the outside of the cake looking_(UnrelEv) like flour .
 We start_(UnrelEv) by carefully cracking_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the egg shell and pouring_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the egg into a small cup or bowl to make_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) sure_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) we do not have_(RelNScrEv) a bad egg .
 Then we pour_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it into the mixing bowl .
 If we need_(Unclear) more than one egg , we do_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) each one separately the same way .
 Then we measure_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) out_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the amount of oil needed_(RelNScrEv) and pour_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it into the mixing bowl , too .
 Then my granddaughter mixes_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) up_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the eggs and oil really well .
 Next , I measure_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) out_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the amount of liquid -LRB- water or milk -RRB- called_(RelNScrEv) for_(RelNScrEv) in the directions .
 She adds_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the liquid to the egg and oil mixture and stirs_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) it all up really well .
 Then we add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the cake mix , a little at a time , stirring_(ScrEv_make_dough) well to mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) .
 Then I pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake batter into the baking pan and spread_(RelNScrEv) it evenly with a spatula .
 Next , I carefully put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake pan into the oven and set_(ScrEv_set_time) a timer to check_(ScrEv_check) it to see_(UnrelEv) if it is done_(ScrEv_wait) .
 We check_(ScrEv_check) to see_(UnrelEv) if it is done_(ScrEv_wait) by putting_(ScrEv_check) a clean toothpick into the center of the cake .
 If it comes_(ScrEv_check) out_(ScrEv_check) with little or none of the cake batter stuck_(RelNScrEv) to the toothpick , it is done_(ScrEv_wait) and ready to take_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) out_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) of the oven , using_(RelNScrEv) pot holders .
 If there is_(RelNScrEv) still gooey stuff on the toothpick , the cake needs to be baked_(ScrEv_wait) a little longer and then tested_(ScrEv_check) again .
 We are_(UnrelEv) eager to see_(ScrEv_check) how our cake turns_(Unclear) out_(Unclear) .
 We play_(UnrelEv) games while we wait_(ScrEv_wait) for it to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 Then we taste_(ScrEv_eat) a little piece before we put_(ScrEv_decorate) frosting on the rest of the cake .

 Twenty minutes later a delicious cake goes_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) into the oven and another 45 minutes later a wonderful smelling_(RelNScrEv) masterpiece comes_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) out of it .
 Ten minutes to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) slightly and then flip_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it over onto a board to finish_(UnrelEv) cooling_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 I sneak_(ScrEv_eat) a taste from one corner and find_(UnrelEv) it is_(UnrelEv) as delicious as it looks_(UnrelEv) and smells_(RelNScrEv) .

 Last night , I had to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for my son 's birthday party .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) online to find_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe to follow_(RelNScrEv) that a lot of people seemed_(UnrelEv) to like_(UnrelEv) .
 I found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a great chocolate cake recipe and printed_(UnrelEv) it out .
 Once it was done_(UnrelEv) being printed_(UnrelEv) , I brought_(RelNScrEv) it into the kitchen and started_(UnrelEv) gathering_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) supplies .
 Among the supplies were_(UnrelEv) eggs , flour , sugar , and more .
 First thing 's first : I had to set_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven for 350 degrees .
 The best way to follow_(RelNScrEv) a baking_(RelNScrEv) recipe is by adding_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the dry ingredients like flour and baking powder together first .
 Once those are mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) together , the wet ingredients are mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) together and added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) to the dry ingredients .
 I followed_(RelNScrEv) the measurements in the recipe and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) together the cake batter .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a rectangle cake pan , oiled_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) it and shook_(ScrEv_other) some flour around the edges .
 I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake into the pan and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it into the oven for about 18 minutes .
 When I thought_(UnrelEv) it was done_(RelNScrEv) , I checked_(ScrEv_check) the cake with a toothpick by putting_(UnrelEv) it in the middle .
 The toothpick came_(RelNScrEv) out clean , without any batter on it , so I knew_(UnrelEv) the cake was done_(RelNScrEv) .
 I let_(UnrelEv) it cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) for a few hours , added_(ScrEv_decorate) icing , and enjoyed_(ScrEv_eat) it at the birthday party .

 Me and my friend decided_(UnrelEv) we would bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for our best friends birthday as opposed_(UnrelEv) to purchasing_(UnrelEv) it from a bakery like we usually do_(UnrelEv) .
 First we headed_(ScrEv_other) out to the grocery store to pick_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) up our baking supplies .
 My friend took_(ScrEv_get_utensils) care of the appliances and pans while I handle_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the flour , sugar , frosting , and eggs .
 When we arrived_(RelNScrEv) home we cleaned_(ScrEv_other) our utensils and began_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 First we started_(UnrelEv) by pouring_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the cake batter in the bowl and cracking_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) two eggs into the powder .
 Next we beat_(ScrEv_make_dough) the mixture with a mixer until it was_(UnrelEv) a creamy texture .
 We added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the sugar , the flour , and the chocolate for an extra boost of flavor .
 Finally Our cake was_(UnrelEv) nice and mixed_(RelNScrEv) so we set_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to three hundred fifty degrees and baked_(RelNScrEv) the cake .
 While the cake was baking_(RelNScrEv) my friend prepared_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the homemade_(RelNScrEv) vanilla frosting .
 After an hour we took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake out of the oven and were met_(UnrelEv) with an amazing aroma .
 We decorated_(ScrEv_decorate) the cake with our homemade_(RelNScrEv) vanilla frosting and placed_(ScrEv_other) the cake in a glass cover so that it would remain_(UnrelEv) fresh for our friend that night .

 I was living_(UnrelEv) in Austin Texas and decided_(UnrelEv) I was going to try_(UnrelEv) my luck at making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I researched_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a few to try out .
 The first one that I made_(Evoking) was a layered Italian cake with white frosting and coconut flakes .
 This one took_(UnrelEv) a lot of effort due to the multiple layers , but the taste ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) being excellent .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) I would try_(UnrelEv) my luck next with a chocolate ganash frosting on top of a peanut butter cake .
 This cake came_(ScrEv_other) out_(ScrEv_other) better tasting_(ScrEv_eat) in my opinion and the in the opinion of others .
 For the peanut butter portion of it , it had_(UnrelEv) peanut butter mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) with actual butter baked_(ScrEv_other) on top of a graham cracker compressed_(UnrelEv) crust .
 The ganash was made_(UnrelEv) from melting_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) chocolate in heavy whipping cream briefly in the microwave and spreading_(ScrEv_decorate) over .
 Once cooled_(ScrEv_cool_down) it made_(UnrelEv) kind of a shell on top of the peanut butter .

 This weekend , I decided_(UnrelEv) I wanted_(UnrelEv) to try_(UnrelEv) baking_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) first_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe online for an easy to make_(RelNScrEv) cake , printed_(RelNScrEv) out a list of the ingredients , and went_(ScrEv_other) to the grocery store to get_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) them .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) about some of the common things , like eggs , flour , and sugar , but the list helped_(UnrelEv) me get_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a lot of things I did n't own_(UnrelEv) and would n't know_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) .
 When I got_(RelNScrEv) home , I followed_(RelNScrEv) the recipe as closely as I could , adding_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) each of the ingredients at the exact amount of the recipe asked_(UnrelEv) for .
 I mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) them all up as described_(UnrelEv) , and put_(ScrEv_pour_dough) them into a pan that I had borrowed_(UnrelEv) from my mother .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the pan in the oven and let_(UnrelEv) the cake cook_(RelNScrEv) .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check) on it occasionally to see_(UnrelEv) if it was looking_(UnrelEv) ok , and because I was_(UnrelEv) really excited_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) how it was turning_(UnrelEv) out .
 When it was done_(UnrelEv) in the oven I removed_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it , and applied_(ScrEv_decorate) an extra thick coat of frosting .
 I was_(UnrelEv) supposed_(UnrelEv) to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for the cake to cook_(RelNScrEv) , but I was_(UnrelEv) too excited to try_(UnrelEv) it out and ate_(ScrEv_eat) it much sooner than recommended_(UnrelEv) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) delicious !

 I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a recipe book .
 I looked_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) up_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a cake that I thought_(UnrelEv) my wife might like .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) a devil 's food cake would be_(UnrelEv) perfect .
 I started_(UnrelEv) by preheating_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to 350 degrees .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) down_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the dry ingredients - flour , sugar , baking powder , cocoa powder - measured_(ScrEv_other) out_(ScrEv_other) the quantities the recipe said_(UnrelEv) and put_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) them in a bowl .
 Then I got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the wet ingredients - eggs , oil , milk - and mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) those up in a separate bowl .
 Then I combined_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the two bowls together and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) them thoroughly .
 I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the contents into two pans and then put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) them in the oven .
 About a half hour later I took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the two pans out of the oven and let_(UnrelEv) them cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 When they were_(UnrelEv) cool enough , I took_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a can on frosting out of the cupboard and iced_(ScrEv_decorate) the two layers , stacking_(ScrEv_decorate) on on the other .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) it looked_(UnrelEv) pretty good .
 Happy birthday , honey !

 I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) the other day .
 I took_(ScrEv_other) a look around my kitchen and I had_(UnrelEv) everything I needed_(RelNScrEv) , so I did n't need_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) to the store .
 I pulled_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) up a recipe on my tablet and started_(UnrelEv) collecting_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all the ingredients .
 Once I had_(UnrelEv) everything on the counter , I looked_(ScrEv_other) at what measures I would need_(UnrelEv) and got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) out the cups and teaspoons and all the bowls I 'd need to mix_(RelNScrEv) it in .
 I started_(UnrelEv) by measuring_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) out the dry ingredients like flour and sugar and put_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) them in the bowl .
 Then I added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) things like the eggs and milk and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) it all up using_(UnrelEv) my electric mixer .
 About halfway through I turned_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven on to preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) .
 I finished_(UnrelEv) mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) everything and got_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it into the cake pan .
 I set_(ScrEv_set_time) a timer and stated_(UnrelEv) putting_(UnrelEv) the dirty dished in the sink to wash_(ScrEv_other) .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) that_(UnrelEv) they would keep_(UnrelEv) for a little while and waited_(ScrEv_wait) until later that night .
 When the cake was done_(UnrelEv) I let_(UnrelEv) it cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) off and put_(ScrEv_decorate) chocolate frosting on it .
 Everyone agreed_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) a really good cake , and washing_(RelNScrEv) the dishes was_(UnrelEv) n't that hard .
 I think_(UnrelEv) I 'll bake_(RelNScrEv) a little more often .

 Yesterday , I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for my friend 's birthday .
 First , I preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) my oven to 350 degrees .
 I then took_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a square cake pan out of my cabinet and rubbed_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) butter all over the pan .
 I sprinkled_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) flour in the pan so that the cake would not stick_(UnrelEv) to it .
 I then took_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a chocolate cake mix that I purchased_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) yesterday at the grocery store out of my food pantry .
 I opened_(RelNScrEv) the cake mix and poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it into a large bowl .
 I measured_(RelNScrEv) one cup of water in a measuring cup and poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the water into the bowl with the cake mix .
 I then measured_(RelNScrEv) one-third cups of vegetable oil and also poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the oil into the cake mix bowl .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) to my refrigerator and got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) three eggs out of the carton .
 I cracked_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) all three eggs , one at a time , into the bowl .
 I turned_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) my mixer and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) the cake mix , water , vegetable oil , and eggs all together in the bowl for about three minutes .
 When all the ingredients were fully mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) together and formed_(ScrEv_make_dough) a batter , I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into the square cake pan .
 Since I had already preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven , I put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the pan into the oven .
 I let_(UnrelEv) the cake cook_(ScrEv_wait) for about twenty minutes until it was done .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake out of the oven and let it cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 After about thirty minutes , I opened_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a can of vanilla frosting and spread_(ScrEv_decorate) the frosting across the top of the cake .
 Finally , I placed_(ScrEv_decorate) some birthday candles on the cake to celebrate_(UnrelEv) my friend 's birthday .
 Today , we ate_(ScrEv_eat) the cake and it was_(UnrelEv) delicious !

 My friend and his wife have_(UnrelEv) a dessert business and baking_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) their specialty .
 Often , they 'll call_(UnrelEv) me up to help_(UnrelEv) them out in the shop for a few extra dollars if I have_(UnrelEv) the time .
 I am_(UnrelEv) always up to doing_(UnrelEv) it !
 It is_(UnrelEv) messy , but it is_(UnrelEv) fun , and I can lick_(RelNScrEv) the spoon !
 Anyway , they were baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) few_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) the other day , and I came_(UnrelEv) over_(UnrelEv) just in time to help_(UnrelEv) them with their last order .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) on_(RelNScrEv) my apron as we got_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) out_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the flour , eggs , sugar , butter , and cake mix .
 We poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the cake mix , sugar , and flour in a bowl while we melted_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the butter and mixed_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it in with the eggs and some added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) water .
 Then , we mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) everything together with a beater .
 I swear_(UnrelEv) , that is_(UnrelEv) always the best part of baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) !
 I licked_(RelNScrEv) the little beater things clean while my friend 's wife greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the pans .
 We then pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake batter into the pans and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it into the oven which had already been preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) to 350 degrees .
 We left_(ScrEv_wait) them in the oven for 25 minutes and once they were done_(ScrEv_wait) , we got_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) them out and put_(ScrEv_cool_down) them on a window sill to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .

 It was_(UnrelEv) my mom 's birthday , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) her_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) special_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .

 For my 13th birthday I decided_(UnrelEv) I 'd bake_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) own_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) instead of having_(UnrelEv) my Mom buy_(UnrelEv) one for me .
 To keep_(UnrelEv) it simple my Mom bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a Betty Crocker cake mix .
 Once my friends arrived_(UnrelEv) we gathered_(UnrelEv) in the kitchen to make_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 The first thing we did_(UnrelEv) was set_(ScrEv_preheat) the stove to the temperature indicated_(RelNScrEv) on the box .
 While the stove warmed_(ScrEv_preheat) up_(ScrEv_preheat) I asked_(UnrelEv) my friend Nikki to be_(UnrelEv) in charge of getting_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) things from the fridge while my friend Stephanie went_(UnrelEv) to the cabinets to get_(ScrEv_get_utensils) whatever I called_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) that was needed_(Unclear) there .
 Once we had_(Unclear) the bowls , measuring cups , and liquid ingredients from the fridge we were_(UnrelEv) ready to start_(UnrelEv) mixing_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) .
 Three people making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) a bit difficult to do_(UnrelEv) , but we had_(UnrelEv) fun talking_(UnrelEv) while we were doing_(UnrelEv) it and I ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) doing_(UnrelEv) most of it while my friends chatted_(UnrelEv) with me .
 I put_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the mix in the bowl and added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the fresh ingredients .
 We took_(UnrelEv) turns mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) that up and then poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the mix into a cake pan that Nikki greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) with some butter .
 I then put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake into the stove while wearing_(RelNScrEv) oven mitts and set_(ScrEv_set_time) the stove 's timer to the suggested_(RelNScrEv) baking time on the box .
 While it baked_(ScrEv_wait) we could n't help_(UnrelEv) spooning_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) some icing for ourselves .

 My best friend was having_(UnrelEv) a birthday party in a few days , so I wanted_(UnrelEv) to make_(Evoking) her_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) that everyone would love_(UnrelEv) .
 I looked_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) through my book of recipes and found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe for chocolate cake that looked_(UnrelEv) delicious .
 The recipe had_(RelNScrEv) a list of ingredients and steps for making_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I read_(ScrEv_other) the whole thing to make_(UnrelEv) sure I did n't have to go_(RelNScrEv) to the store to buy_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) any of the food or cooking supplies needed to make_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 It said_(UnrelEv) I needed_(RelNScrEv) a big bowl , a mixer , a spatula , measuring cups , a pot , and a baking dish .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_utensils) each of these out of my cabinets and placed_(ScrEv_other) them on the table so they were_(UnrelEv) ready to use_(RelNScrEv) .
 Then it said_(UnrelEv) I needed_(RelNScrEv) two eggs , flour , sugar , milk , chocolate , and frosting .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) these out of my cabinets and refrigerator so that they were_(UnrelEv) ready as well .
 Once I was_(UnrelEv) sure I had_(UnrelEv) everything I needed_(RelNScrEv) , I started_(UnrelEv) reading_(ScrEv_other) the instructions again , one by one .
 On the first step , I had to preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven by turning_(ScrEv_preheat) it to the right temperature early so that it is_(UnrelEv) warm enough to bake_(RelNScrEv) when I am_(UnrelEv) ready to put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the batter inside .
 Then I had to start_(UnrelEv) making_(ScrEv_make_dough) the batter .
 First I cracked_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the eggs into the big bowl and threw_(ScrEv_other) away the shells .
 Then I used_(UnrelEv) my measuring cups to very carefully scoop_(RelNScrEv) the exact amount of flour the recipe asked for and poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it in the bowl .
 Next I measured_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) and poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the sugar and milk the same way .
 I put_(ScrEv_other) the mixer into the bowl and turned_(ScrEv_make_dough) it on for a minute .
 When I turned_(ScrEv_other) it off again , I could no longer see_(UnrelEv) each ingredient , and the batter looked_(UnrelEv) like sticky goop instead .
 The recipe then said_(UnrelEv) to melt_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the chocolate on the stove in the pot .
 I put_(ScrEv_other) the chocolate in the pot on the stove , turned_(ScrEv_other) it on , and watched_(UnrelEv) it turn_(UnrelEv) from solid to liquid .
 Then I poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it into the big bowl and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) it up again .
 Once I had_(UnrelEv) my chocolate batter , I gently poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it into my baking dish and was_(UnrelEv) ready to put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it into the oven .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) on oven mitts to protect_(RelNScrEv) my hands from the heat and carefully put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the dish into the oven .
 Following_(RelNScrEv) the recipe 's instructions , I set_(ScrEv_set_time) the oven timer for an hour and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for it to bake_(RelNScrEv) .
 Once I heard_(UnrelEv) the timer chime_(ScrEv_other) , I put_(RelNScrEv) on the oven mitts again and took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake out to cool_(RelNScrEv) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_other) the oven off and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the cake to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) down .
 The batter was_(UnrelEv) now soft and firm instead of goop .
 Once it was_(UnrelEv) cool , I put_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it on a plate and spread the frosting all over it with my spatula .
 Finally , the cake was done_(UnrelEv) .
 It smelled_(RelNScrEv) delicious !

 When the cake batter was_(ScrEv_make_dough) complete , I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it into a pan and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it in the oven that was_(ScrEv_preheat) already hot .

 It came_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) great and was very chocolaty tasting_(ScrEv_eat) .
 Now the cake was done_(ScrEv_wait) so I took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it out to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) off_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 It looked_(ScrEv_check) very nice .
 When it had cooled_(ScrEv_cool_down) off_(ScrEv_cool_down) , I proceeded_(UnrelEv) to frost_(ScrEv_decorate) the cake with the icing I had made_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) hard at first , but I got_(UnrelEv) the hang of it and was_(UnrelEv) able to smooth_(ScrEv_decorate) out_(ScrEv_decorate) any lumps I made_(UnrelEv) very easily .
 I put_(ScrEv_decorate) some candles on the cake to finish_(UnrelEv) it .
 When I gave_(RelNScrEv) it to my friend , she was_(UnrelEv) so excited .
 We lit_(RelNScrEv) her candles and she blew_(RelNScrEv) them out .
 We all had_(ScrEv_eat) a slice of cake and everyone agreed_(UnrelEv) that this was_(UnrelEv) the best tasting_(ScrEv_eat) cake they had ever had_(ScrEv_eat) .

 After reviewing_(RelNScrEv) the recipe and getting_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake in the oven at the correct temperature , I decided_(UnrelEv) taking_(UnrelEv) a quick break would be_(UnrelEv) a good idea .
 I heated_(UnrelEv) leftovers from the night before , and had_(UnrelEv) that for lunch while waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for my now baked_(ScrEv_wait) cakes to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 After that , building_(ScrEv_decorate) the cake was_(UnrelEv) so simple !
 It turned_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) to my standards , I loved_(UnrelEv) it !

 I like_(UnrelEv) to help Mom bake_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) .
 It 's something we enjoy_(UnrelEv) doing together .
 Mom decided_(UnrelEv) she was going to make_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) chocolate_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) , and chocolate is_(UnrelEv) my favorite !
 First , we washed_(RelNScrEv) our hands carefully with plenty of soap .
 Then we dried_(RelNScrEv) our hands .
 The first thing we had to do_(UnrelEv) was sift_(RelNScrEv) the dry ingredients .
 Mom got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) out_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a really big mixing bowl made of aluminum .
 We put_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) in_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the flour , sugar , salt , and baking powder .
 Mom likes_(UnrelEv) turbinado sugar the best because it 's_(UnrelEv) more healthy , so we used_(UnrelEv) that .
 The four was_(UnrelEv) King Arthur cake flour .
 We blended_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the dry ingredients carefully with a whip .
 Then we got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) another bowl and mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the eggs , milk , and butter .
 Mom took_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a little pan and melted_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the chocolate on the stove on very low heat .
 We mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the chocolate with the liquids and then poured_(ScrEv_make_dough) it all into the big bowl .
 We baked_(ScrEv_wait) the cake for 40 minutes -- it seemed_(UnrelEv) like a long time !
 -- and after it cooled_(ScrEv_cool_down) we iced_(ScrEv_decorate) it and ate_(ScrEv_eat) some .
 It was_(UnrelEv) delicious .

 Today , in Rich 's Kitchen we 'll learn_(UnrelEv) about the fine attributes of baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 Since I am_(UnrelEv) not a phenomenal baker we will be assisted_(UnrelEv) by the use of Little Debbie in using_(RelNScrEv) one of their fine cake mixes .
 In order to properly make_(Evoking) this_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) we will need_(RelNScrEv) some vegetable oil and a couple of eggs .
 First thing to do_(UnrelEv) is pre-heat_(ScrEv_preheat) our oven to the time listed_(UnrelEv) on the box .
 Then we will gather_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the vegetable oil and eggs along with two round baking dishes and a bowl for mixing_(RelNScrEv) .
 Use_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) a cooking spray on your two round baking_(RelNScrEv) dishes to prevent_(UnrelEv) sticking_(RelNScrEv) .
 Next we will combine_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the cake mix , vegetable oil , eggs and a little tap water and begin to mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) .
 Once we have_(RelNScrEv) the consistency we are looking_(UnrelEv) for pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the mix evenly in both baking_(RelNScrEv) round dishes and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) them into the oven for the time suggested_(UnrelEv) on the box .
 Make sure to taste_(ScrEv_other) your cake mix for extra delicious value .
 While the cake is baking_(RelNScrEv) clean_(ScrEv_other) up the mess .
 Once baking_(RelNScrEv) has completed_(UnrelEv) let_(UnrelEv) the cake cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) and then you can remove_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) the cakes and frost_(ScrEv_decorate) it with your favorite frosting .

 Baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) can be_(UnrelEv) a lot of fun .
 Plus , at the end , you have_(UnrelEv) a yummy cake to eat_(ScrEv_eat) !
 First , decide_(UnrelEv) what kind of cake_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) make_(Evoking) .
 Do you have_(UnrelEv) a recipe written_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) ?
 A recipe is_(UnrelEv) a set of instructions for making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) particular_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 Make sure to read_(RelNScrEv) the recipe all the way through before you start_(UnrelEv) , so there are_(UnrelEv) no surprises !
 Then gather_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) all your ingredients together : flour , sugar , eggs , and whatever else your recipe says_(UnrelEv) .
 Next , you need to pre-heat_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven .
 Your recipe will tell_(UnrelEv) you what temperature to use_(UnrelEv) .
 While the oven heats_(ScrEv_preheat) up_(ScrEv_preheat) , you mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) your ingredients in a big bowl .
 Next , you need to prepare_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the baking pans .
 Look_(RelNScrEv) again at the recipe .
 It will tell_(UnrelEv) you what size pan to use_(UnrelEv) , and whether it needs to be greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) .
 To grease_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) a pan means to put_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) a thin layer of shortening or butter on the bottom and sides , so the cake wo n't stick_(UnrelEv) .
 You 'll use_(UnrelEv) two pans if you 're making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) layered_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 When the pan or pans are_(UnrelEv) ready , pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) in the well-mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) ingredients .
 Check_(RelNScrEv) if the oven is hot enough -- has it reached_(UnrelEv) the temperature you set_(ScrEv_preheat) it to yet ?
 If so , slide_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) your pan right into the middle of the oven , and close_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it up .
 The recipe will say_(UnrelEv) how many minutes it will take_(ScrEv_wait) for the cake to bake_(ScrEv_wait) .
 It 's a good idea to set_(ScrEv_set_time) a timer , because you do n't want to forget_(UnrelEv) about it , and have_(UnrelEv) a burnt_(RelNScrEv) cake , after all your hard work !
 While the cake cooks_(ScrEv_wait) , it 's a good idea to clean_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the kitchen .
 You 're_(UnrelEv) almost there !
 When your timer goes_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) , you can check_(ScrEv_check) if the cake is done by sticking_(ScrEv_check) a toothpick into the middle .
 If the toothpick comes_(ScrEv_check) out_(ScrEv_check) dry , and not gooey , your cake is done .
 Turn_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) off_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) the oven , and carefully remove_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the hot cake with oven mitts on .
 Unfortunately , now you have to leave_(UnrelEv) it alone until it cools_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 When it 's cooled_(ScrEv_cool_down) , turn_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it out of the pan , and put_(ScrEv_decorate) the frosting on , if your cake is_(UnrelEv) a frosted_(ScrEv_decorate) cake .
 Next is_(UnrelEv) the best part : slice_(ScrEv_eat) that cake into eight , put_(ScrEv_eat) a slice on a plate , and enjoy_(ScrEv_eat) !

 Last Christmas I had to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for myself , and it was_(UnrelEv) a bit of a doozy .
 I do n't know_(UnrelEv) a lot about making_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) , but I have_(UnrelEv) a super-huge baking pan , an oven , and a big sweet tooth !
 I left_(UnrelEv) the house looking_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) around_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) various convenience stores for cake mix ; it was_(UnrelEv) Christmas , so going_(UnrelEv) to a big store and wasting_(UnrelEv) a bunch of time was_(UnrelEv) out of the question .

 Since my pan was_(UnrelEv) way too big for just one box , I had to follow_(Unclear) the instructions and double_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) every ingredient while making_(ScrEv_make_dough) the batter and pouring_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it in .

 I checked_(ScrEv_check) the cake several times with a toothpick to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it was fully baked_(ScrEv_wait) .

 Today I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) so we could have_(ScrEv_eat) it for dessert with tonight 's dinner .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) a chocolate cake would be_(UnrelEv) nice , so I took_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) my cookbook and looked_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) for_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe for chocolate cake .
 There were_(UnrelEv) a few different chocolate cake recipes , but I picked_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) one that was called_(UnrelEv) devil 's food cake .
 The recipe had_(RelNScrEv) a list of ingredients , so I checked_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) my cupboard to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I had_(UnrelEv) everything I would need_(UnrelEv) .
 When I was_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I did_(UnrelEv) , I got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) out_(ScrEv_get_utensils) 2 mixing bowls and a cake pan .
 The recipe said_(UnrelEv) to preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to 350 degrees , so I turned_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven on and set_(ScrEv_preheat) the temperature for 350 .
 Then I took_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a bit of butter and rubbed_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) it all over the inside of the cake pan .
 That would make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the cake did n't stick_(RelNScrEv) in the pan and I would be able to get_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it out without any trouble .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) out_(ScrEv_get_utensils) my electric mixer and put_(ScrEv_get_utensils) the beaters in , then plugged_(ScrEv_get_utensils) the mixer in the electrical outlet .
 As I read_(RelNScrEv) the directions from the recipe , I put_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the butter and sugar in one of the bowls .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) the beaters in the bowl and turned_(RelNScrEv) on_(RelNScrEv) the electric mixer , holding_(RelNScrEv) it really tightly as it mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the butter and sugar until it was_(UnrelEv) fluffy .
 I cracked_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) some eggs , and added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) them to the bowl and beat_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) that some more .
 In another bowl I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) flour , baking powder , cocoa powder and all the rest of the dry ingredients .
 Then I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the wet ingredients with the dry ones and mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) them all together with the electric mixer until the batter was_(UnrelEv) smooth .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) , I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter in my cake pan and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it in the oven .
 The recipe said_(UnrelEv) it would take_(ScrEv_wait) 30 minutes to cook_(ScrEv_wait) , so I looked_(ScrEv_set_time) at_(ScrEv_set_time) the clock in my kitchen to see_(UnrelEv) what time it was_(UnrelEv) .
 Then I added_(ScrEv_set_time) 30 minutes to the time and knew_(UnrelEv) when my cake would be_(Unclear) ready .
 When 30 minutes was_(ScrEv_wait) up_(ScrEv_wait) , I opened_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the oven and looked_(ScrEv_check) at_(ScrEv_check) the cake .
 It looked_(ScrEv_check) done_(ScrEv_wait) , but to be_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I took_(ScrEv_check) a toothpick and stuck_(ScrEv_check) it in the middle of the cake .
 If it came_(ScrEv_check) out_(ScrEv_check) clean , I 'd know_(UnrelEv) the cake was done_(ScrEv_check) .
 If it came_(ScrEv_check) out_(ScrEv_check) full of wet cake batter , it was not done_(ScrEv_check) yet , and would need_(UnrelEv) a bit longer to cook_(ScrEv_wait) .
 The toothpick came_(ScrEv_check) out_(ScrEv_check) clean .
 My cake was done_(ScrEv_check) .
 I put_(ScrEv_get_utensils) on_(ScrEv_get_utensils) a potholder glove so I would n't get_(UnrelEv) burned_(RelNScrEv) and removed_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake from the oven .
 I put_(ScrEv_cool_down) it on a wire rack on my kitchen counter so it could cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) off_(ScrEv_cool_down) before I tried_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it from the pan .
 When it was_(ScrEv_cool_down) cool , I flipped_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) the pan over onto the rack and the cake fell_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) out_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) of the pan .
 It looked_(UnrelEv) good , and I knew_(UnrelEv) everyone would enjoy_(ScrEv_eat) the chocolate cake that night at dinner .

 Then , following_(Unclear) the directions in the recipe I found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) in my cookbook , I measured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) out_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the correct quantities for all the ingredients .
 I then made_(ScrEv_make_dough) the cake batter following_(Unclear) the step-by-step instructions in the recipe .
 When the batter was made_(ScrEv_make_dough) , I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it into my greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) cake pan .
 I then placed_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake in the oven and set_(ScrEv_set_time) the kitchen timer to 45 minutes .
 When the timer rang_(ScrEv_wait) , I removed_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake from the oven , using_(UnrelEv) kitchen mitts so I would n't burn_(RelNScrEv) my hands .
 I then placed_(ScrEv_cool_down) the pan on the counter for 5 minutes .
 After 5 minutes had passed_(ScrEv_cool_down) , I carefully removed_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) the cake from the pan and placed_(ScrEv_cool_down) it on a wire rack to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 When the cake was_(ScrEv_cool_down) completely cool , I iced_(ScrEv_decorate) it with chocolate frosting .

 For my sons birthday we decided_(UnrelEv) to cut_(UnrelEv) costs in order to splurge_(UnrelEv) on more expensive electronic gifts by doing_(UnrelEv) as many diy projects as possible including_(UnrelEv) what most would consider_(UnrelEv) the easiest task baking_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 He had_(UnrelEv) his heart set_(UnrelEv) on a carrot cake this year , this would be_(UnrelEv) my first carrot cake attempt ca n't be_(UnrelEv) too hard can_(UnrelEv) it ?
 First off finding_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) the right recipie is_(UnrelEv) not the 5 minute take_(UnrelEv) I thought_(UnrelEv) I was tackling_(UnrelEv) .
 Nuts , no nuts , raisin , gluten free , pureed_(RelNScrEv) or shredded_(RelNScrEv) carrots were_(UnrelEv) just some of the decisions I was faced_(UnrelEv) with .
 We chose_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) all out , homeade_(RelNScrEv) icing and all .
 -LRB- I did not churn_(UnrelEv) the cream cheese -RRB- After selecting_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) my recipie I headed_(ScrEv_other) to the store to get_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) my list of ingredients I did not have_(RelNScrEv) on hand spending_(RelNScrEv) a total of $ 7.00 , not to shabby !
 Once home I got_(UnrelEv) to work_(RelNScrEv) on a test cake .
 After measuring_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) ingredients , shredding_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) carrots , soaking_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) raisins , chopping_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) nuts and zesting_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) lemons I began_(UnrelEv) mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) the batter .
 Nothing to hard there into the 2 round greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) and floured_(ScrEv_other) pans I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the unlattering colored_(UnrelEv) goop .
 With orange stained_(UnrelEv) hands I started_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) on the frosting .
 A word advise remember_(UnrelEv) to take_(RelNScrEv) out the cream cheese from the fridge and never microwave_(RelNScrEv) , this tip is_(UnrelEv) from experience , not a mistake I 'm willing_(UnrelEv) to share_(UnrelEv) with most .
 The house smelled_(UnrelEv) of a delicious fall afternoon the cinnamon bringing_(UnrelEv) all the kids out of the depths of their video games drooling_(UnrelEv) .
 After letting_(UnrelEv) the cakes cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) for a hour or more I returned_(UnrelEv) to assemble_(ScrEv_other) and frost_(ScrEv_decorate) the finger poked_(ScrEv_check) cake .
 -LRB- sneaky kids -RRB- I 'm_(UnrelEv) no cake boss so the finish product is best pictured_(UnrelEv) entering_(ScrEv_eat) the mouths of preteens but the reviews recieved_(UnrelEv) two vertical thumbs from the birthday boy .

 After my oven was done_(UnrelEv) pre-heating_(ScrEv_preheat) I placed_(UnrelEv) the pan into the oven .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) for it to finish_(RelNScrEv) before taking_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) out the freshly baked_(RelNScrEv) cake .
 I then took_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the frosting and brushed_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) it against the outside of the cake .
 Following that I tossed_(ScrEv_decorate) some sprinkles on the top to make_(UnrelEv) it look_(UnrelEv) nice .

 It was_(UnrelEv) my sisters birthday recently and she wanted to have_(UnrelEv) a cake , of course .
 She likes_(UnrelEv) chocolate , so she chose_(UnrelEv) a chocolate cake .
 We always bake_(Evoking) our_(Evoking) own_(Evoking) cakes_(Evoking) rather than purchasing_(UnrelEv) them , so I knew_(UnrelEv) we needed_(UnrelEv) to find_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a tried and true recipe .
 We found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) the recipe from a blog and made_(RelNScrEv) a list of the ingredients that we did not already have_(UnrelEv) .
 We had to do_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a trip to the grocery store to pick_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) up_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) a few items that are_(UnrelEv) essential to baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) chocolate_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) , one of which is_(UnrelEv) baker 's chocolate .
 Once we got_(RelNScrEv) home from the store , we followed_(UnrelEv) the instructions included_(UnrelEv) in the recipe .
 We started_(UnrelEv) like always ; by pre-heating_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to the correct temperature .
 Next , we began_(UnrelEv) to make_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 First , we make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) dry ingredients are mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) well and then we moved_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) to the wet ingredients .
 This is_(UnrelEv) so important for the distribution of things like the baking soda .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) what makes_(UnrelEv) a cake a cake .
 When the cake batter was_(UnrelEv) ready and the oven was_(UnrelEv) hot , we poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into a pan and slipped_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the pan in the oven .
 The timer was set_(ScrEv_set_time) for the correct amount of time given_(UnrelEv) by the recipe , and then we just waited_(ScrEv_wait) .
 Once the cake was done we took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it out of the oven and set_(UnrelEv) it up to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) before we put_(ScrEv_decorate) on_(ScrEv_decorate) the icing .
 The cake turned_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) beautiful and my sister had_(UnrelEv) a very happy birthday .

 Today I decided_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for my daughter 's birthday .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) she would want_(UnrelEv) a chocolate cake , so I went_(RelNScrEv) to the store to purchase_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) ingredients .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) cake mix and frosting , as well as ingredients necessary to make_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) such as eggs and oil .
 I came_(RelNScrEv) home and made_(ScrEv_other) sure that my kitchen was_(UnrelEv) clean and ready to bake_(RelNScrEv) in .
 I set_(UnrelEv) the oven to preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) and went_(UnrelEv) about mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) up the cake batter .
 While the oven was preheating_(ScrEv_preheat) , I greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) and floured_(ScrEv_other) a cake pan and dumped_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into it .
 Finally , the oven beeped_(ScrEv_other) which signaled_(UnrelEv) that it was ready .
 I placed_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake on the middle rack in the oven and shut_(ScrEv_other) the oven door .
 I checked_(ScrEv_other) the back of the cake mix box to see timing instructions for the pan size I chose_(UnrelEv) , and set_(ScrEv_set_time) the built-in timer on my oven accordingly .
 While the cake was baking_(RelNScrEv) , I cleaned_(ScrEv_other) up my mess .
 I wiped_(ScrEv_other) down the counters , put_(ScrEv_other) the mixer away , and loaded_(ScrEv_other) the dishwasher .
 Once the timer went_(ScrEv_other) off , I removed_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake from the oven and set_(UnrelEv) it aside to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 Once it was_(UnrelEv) cool , I frosted_(ScrEv_decorate) and decorated_(ScrEv_decorate) it .
 That 's how I baked_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .

 I recently made_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for a friend to thank_(UnrelEv) them for helping_(UnrelEv) me with something .
 Since I knew_(UnrelEv) that they liked_(UnrelEv) chocolate cake the best , I looked_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) in my cookbook for a good recipe to follow_(RelNScrEv) .
 I soon found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) one that looked_(UnrelEv) tasty and I had_(UnrelEv) all of the ingredients on hand , since that 's_(UnrelEv) the first thing that I do_(UnrelEv) before committing_(RelNScrEv) to a recipe , since I do_(UnrelEv) n't want to have to run_(RelNScrEv) to the store in the middle of making_(RelNScrEv) something .
 I set_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to the appropriate temperature , after being_(UnrelEv) sure to double check_(ScrEv_other) it .
 From my cabinets I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) out the flour , sugar and other dry ingredients that the recipe called for and measured_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) them out by using_(RelNScrEv) my food scale .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) some eggs and butter out the fridge too .
 Then I followed_(UnrelEv) along with the recipe and added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the ingredients , in order , to my mixer .
 I turned_(ScrEv_other) it on its lowest setting and let_(UnrelEv) it all mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) until it was well blended_(RelNScrEv) .
 I next took_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) out the proper sized_(UnrelEv) pan and greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) it with the butter wrapper .
 Then I turned_(ScrEv_other) off the mixer and slowly added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the batter to my pan .
 The whole thing went_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) in the preheated_(RelNScrEv) over and I set_(ScrEv_set_time) a timer .
 When it went_(ScrEv_other) off later , I poked_(ScrEv_check) the cake with a toothpick and it came_(RelNScrEv) out clean , so that meant_(UnrelEv) that the cake was done_(UnrelEv) .
 I pulled_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it out and set_(ScrEv_other) it out to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) for a while .
 Later in the evening , I used_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) premade frosting , since that 's what my friend likes the most , and frosted_(ScrEv_decorate) the cake .
 It came_(UnrelEv) out looking_(UnrelEv) pretty good .

 Once I arrived_(RelNScrEv) home , I preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) my oven to 350 degrees .
 I measured_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the amount of each ingredient I would need_(RelNScrEv) .
 In my mixer , I combined_(ScrEv_make_dough) all of the cake ingredients to form_(ScrEv_make_dough) a smooth batter .
 I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into a pan that was coated_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) with cooking spray .
 I baked_(RelNScrEv) the cake for 35 minutes and turned_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) off the oven .
 I let_(UnrelEv) the cake cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) for several hours .

 Once the cake had cooked_(RelNScrEv) , I decorated_(ScrEv_decorate) it with the frosting .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to add_(ScrEv_decorate) a_(ScrEv_decorate) couple strawberries on top to make_(UnrelEv) the cake look_(UnrelEv) nicer .

 Baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) so much fun .
 I always love_(UnrelEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the package from the grocery store since this is_(UnrelEv) the easiest way .
 You just need_(UnrelEv) to mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) the package with some eggs and oil .
 First I would_(UnrelEv) pre-heat_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to about four hundred degrees .
 Then mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) all the cake batter ingredients all together until the consistency of the cake mix is_(UnrelEv) smooth and there are_(UnrelEv) no chunks .
 Then I slowly pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into a cake pan and ensure_(RelNScrEv) that the batter is even in the pan .
 Sometimes I use_(UnrelEv) cooking spray to oil_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the pan and sometimes I forget_(UnrelEv) but honestly I feel_(UnrelEv) like it does not make_(UnrelEv) that big of a difference .
 Then I cook_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake and wait_(ScrEv_wait) until it is done_(UnrelEv) .
 Sometimes I like_(UnrelEv) to look_(UnrelEv) through the window on the oven door and watch_(UnrelEv) how the cake will rise_(RelNScrEv) in the cake pan .
 Then I love_(UnrelEv) to smell_(RelNScrEv) the cake as the aroma fills_(RelNScrEv) the entire house , oh I love_(UnrelEv) this part so much .
 Then the timer beeps_(ScrEv_other) and I am_(UnrelEv) so happy .
 The most important part of baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) , as my mother always told_(UnrelEv) me , is_(UnrelEv) to turn_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) off the oven when the cake is doing_(UnrelEv) baking_(RelNScrEv) .
 I pull_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it out and use_(ScrEv_check) a toothpick to make_(UnrelEv) sure that the cake is done_(UnrelEv) by making_(UnrelEv) sure that the toothpick comes_(RelNScrEv) out clean from the middle of the cake .
 Then I wait_(ScrEv_wait) a while and then I mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) together some frosting .
 I spread_(ScrEv_decorate) the frosting on the cake and cut_(ScrEv_other) myself a piece and I eat_(ScrEv_eat) it !
 It tastes_(UnrelEv) so amazing !

 '' `` Baking_(Evoking) A_(Evoking) Cake_(Evoking) '' '' Grandma June was making_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for uncle Max 's Birthday .
 Uncle Max was_(UnrelEv) 45 years old !
 Julia thought_(UnrelEv) that was pretty old .
 She was_(UnrelEv) excited because , Grandma June agreed_(UnrelEv) to let_(UnrelEv) her help_(UnrelEv) .
 They both washed_(RelNScrEv) their hands Grandma June said_(UnrelEv) that is_(UnrelEv) always the first step you take_(UnrelEv) when cooking_(Evoking) so you do n't spread_(UnrelEv) germs .
 Then Grandma June picked_(ScrEv_get_utensils) two shiny round cake pans .
 She let_(UnrelEv) Julia grease_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) the whole inside of each pan with Shortening and then Grandma June dusted_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) each pan lightly with flour .
 This is so the cooked_(Unclear) cakes would not stick_(UnrelEv) .
 Grandma June turned_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven on to heat_(ScrEv_preheat) up_(ScrEv_preheat) to 350 degrees then she placed_(ScrEv_get_utensils) two bowl onto the counter one was_(UnrelEv) for dry things such as flour , sugar , baking powder and salt .
 Grandma June carefully measured_(RelNScrEv) each one and let Julia pour_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) them in .
 Then she mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) all the dry stuff really well .
 Julia 's Grandma June told_(UnrelEv) her to mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) well but carefully so the ingredients would not spill_(UnrelEv) because baking_(Evoking) is an exact science and the measurements had to be_(UnrelEv) correct .
 In the next bowl they measured_(RelNScrEv) all the wet things .
 In went_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) butter , milk , vanilla and eggs .
 Grandma June mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) them very smooth with a hand mixer .
 Next they slowly added_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the wet ingredients to the dry a bit at a time mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) them well into a smooth batter .
 The batter get divided_(ScrEv_pour_dough) evenly between the two cake pans and placed_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) in the hot oven to bake_(ScrEv_wait) .
 After thirty minutes Grandma June poked_(ScrEv_check) each cake with a toothpick and it came_(ScrEv_check) out_(ScrEv_check) with no cake on it .
 This meant_(UnrelEv) the cakes were done .
 Grandma June carefully flipped_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) the cakes over onto a cooling rack leave_(ScrEv_cool_down) the cake there with no pan on it to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 Julia waited_(ScrEv_wait) for what seemed like a very long time until Grandma June said_(UnrelEv) they were cool .
 She brought_(ScrEv_get_utensils) out_(ScrEv_get_utensils) her cake stand and placed_(UnrelEv) one cake on it .
 Julia watched_(UnrelEv) as Grandma June frosted_(ScrEv_decorate) the layer lightly then placed_(ScrEv_decorate) the other cake on top .
 She made_(UnrelEv) quick work of frosting_(ScrEv_decorate) both layers of stacked cakes with smooth fluffy white frosting .
 Then came_(UnrelEv) Julias part .
 She placed_(ScrEv_decorate) the bid number four and five shaped candles next to each other on the cake .

 For Christmas last year , my family had_(UnrelEv) a very big get together and everyone was tasked_(UnrelEv) with making_(UnrelEv) and\/or bringing_(UnrelEv) a food item .
 I did n't know_(UnrelEv) what to bring_(UnrelEv) , so I simply asked_(UnrelEv) my Aunt what she would like_(UnrelEv) .
 She told_(UnrelEv) me that she would love_(UnrelEv) a cake , as there was_(UnrelEv) a shortage of people bringing_(UnrelEv) dessert .
 I figured_(UnrelEv) that I should bake_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) myself_(Evoking) since I do not bake_(Evoking) fairly often .
 I looked_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) throughout_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) my pantry and realized_(UnrelEv) I had_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) everything I needed_(RelNScrEv) .
 I went_(UnrelEv) ahead_(UnrelEv) and made_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) the evening before using_(Unclear) all of the ingredients .
 I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the flour , sugar , water , eggs and even made_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) my own frosting and did n't use_(RelNScrEv) one from a can .
 It turned_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) very moist , sweet and very good tasting_(ScrEv_eat) .
 The next day I brought_(RelNScrEv) the cake over to my family gathering and it was_(RelNScrEv) a big hit .
 Everyone seemed_(UnrelEv) to enjoy_(ScrEv_eat) it .
 Afterwards , my aunt and other family members thanked_(UnrelEv) me very much .
 I was_(UnrelEv) very happy with myself .

 So while most people will talk_(UnrelEv) about_(UnrelEv) baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) basic_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) out of a box , I am actually going to be writing_(UnrelEv) about re-learning_(UnrelEv) how to bake_(Evoking) one_(Evoking) from_(Evoking) scratch_(Evoking) .
 I just found_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) that I have_(UnrelEv) a gluten intolerance .
 Like , VERY gluten intolerant .
 So , I am re-learning_(UnrelEv) how to do_(UnrelEv) just about everything .
 Most of the time , you can just buy_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) stuff from a box and add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) some eggs , oil and milk and call_(UnrelEv) it good .
 Well , as there are_(UnrelEv) very few gluten free baking premade box mixes , and even fewer that actually taste_(UnrelEv) good , I have been teaching_(UnrelEv) myself how to bake_(Evoking) from_(Evoking) scratch_(Evoking) .
 All I really have to do_(UnrelEv) is mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) and match_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) different flours .
 Wheat flour is_(UnrelEv) sticky and fluffy , but keeps_(UnrelEv) moisture well .
 That is_(UnrelEv) part of the reason so many bake_(Evoking) with it .
 If I just use_(UnrelEv) rice flour , that is top dry .
 If I just use_(UnrelEv) coconut flour , well then it all crumbles_(UnrelEv) .
 So , what I do_(UnrelEv) is buy_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) several different kinds of flours so I can mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) and match_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) their properties and actually make tasty things that are_(UnrelEv) extremely similar to the real deal .
 After I get the flours combined_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) , I just add_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the regular ingredients , figure_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) a baking temperature and stick_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it in .
 Right now I keep_(UnrelEv) a close eye on the food since there are_(UnrelEv) n't a ton of good recipes out there .
 So far it has worked_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) well !

 I had to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) for a birthday party .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) out_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) the ingredients and put_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) them on the counter : flour , sugar , eggs , vanilla , salt , baking soda , and milk .
 I then turned_(ScrEv_preheat) on_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven , setting_(ScrEv_preheat) it at 375 degrees .

 I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the wet ingredients together in a big bowl , and then slowly started_(UnrelEv) adding_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the dry ingredients .

 When they were all mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) together , the batter was_(ScrEv_make_dough) ready_(ScrEv_make_dough) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) the consistence of thick maple syrup .
 I sprayed_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) spray oil on the inside of a pan and then poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake batter into the pan .
 It was_(UnrelEv) ready to go_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) .
 When the oven beeped_(RelNScrEv) to let_(UnrelEv) me know_(UnrelEv) that it was finished_(UnrelEv) preheating_(ScrEv_preheat) , I put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the pan into the oven .
 I put_(ScrEv_set_time) on_(ScrEv_set_time) a timer for 12 minutes .
 When the timer went_(ScrEv_wait) off_(ScrEv_wait) , I opened_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the oven door and took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the pan out .
 I inserted_(ScrEv_check) a toothpick into the center of the cake and took_(ScrEv_check) it out to see_(ScrEv_check) if the cake was done_(ScrEv_wait) : the toothpick came_(ScrEv_check) out_(ScrEv_check) without any batter attached_(RelNScrEv) to it , so the cake was_(UnrelEv) good to go_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) off_(ScrEv_turn_off_oven) the oven and left_(ScrEv_cool_down) the cake in the pan on the counter to cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 After a while I moved_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) the cake to a cooling rack .
 When it was_(ScrEv_cool_down) completely cool I covered_(ScrEv_decorate) it with chocolate frosting and wrote_(ScrEv_decorate) '' `` Happy Birthday ! '' ''
 on the top with a tube of blue icing .
 The cake looked_(UnrelEv) great !

 I was_(UnrelEv) truly a chocolate cake addict but had_(UnrelEv) no clue how to bake_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) one from the supermarket out of the box .

 I poured_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the eggs , water , oil and cake mix in the box and beat_(ScrEv_make_dough) it with my hand blender for about a minute .
 The smell of the gooey chocolate in the bowl make_(UnrelEv) my little bundle of joy inside me kick_(UnrelEv) for joy .
 When I was pouring_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it into the pan to bake_(RelNScrEv) it was_(UnrelEv) hard to resist_(UnrelEv) temptation of a taste .
 But knowing_(UnrelEv) that raw eggs are_(UnrelEv) unhealthy I decided_(UnrelEv) to to_(ScrEv_wait) the twenty five minutes until it was done_(RelNScrEv) .
 When my timer went_(ScrEv_other) off I removed_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) it from the oven and tried_(ScrEv_eat) a small piece .
 It was_(UnrelEv) one of the most moist and delicious cakes I ever had_(ScrEv_eat) .

 It was_(UnrelEv) my little sister 's birthday and I wanted_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) her_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 I found_(ScrEv_choose_recipe) a recipe for chocolate cake , which I knew_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) her favorite .
 I gathered_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) together all of the ingredients along with a bowl and a mixer .
 I measured_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) out the flour , sugar , vanilla , chocolate , eggs , and water and put_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) them into the bowl .
 I used_(UnrelEv) the electric mixer to mix_(ScrEv_make_dough) the batter until it was_(UnrelEv) very smooth .
 I greased_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) a cake pan and put_(ScrEv_other) a little flour into the bottom and shook_(RelNScrEv) it around .
 This would keep_(UnrelEv) the cake from sticking_(RelNScrEv) to the pan while it cooked_(RelNScrEv) .
 I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the batter into the pan and placed_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) it in the oven , which I had preheated_(ScrEv_preheat) to 350 degrees .
 I set_(ScrEv_set_time) a timer for 35 minutes .
 While the cake was baking_(RelNScrEv) , I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) together some sugar , vanilla and milk to make_(RelNScrEv) frosting .
 When the timer sounded_(ScrEv_other) , I took_(ScrEv_take_out_oven) the cake out of the oven and let_(UnrelEv) it cool_(ScrEv_cool_down) .
 I turned_(ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin) it upside down onto a serving platter and put_(ScrEv_decorate) the frosting on .
 I used_(UnrelEv) a special frosting bag and tip to write_(ScrEv_decorate) '' `` Happy Birthday '' '' on the top .
 My sister loved_(UnrelEv) it !

 When I baked_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) , I got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) my dishes out from the cupboard in my kitchen .
 I laid_(ScrEv_other) out all the dishes and ingredients needed_(UnrelEv) to bake_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) .
 After preheating_(UnrelEv) the dishes and preheating_(ScrEv_preheat) the oven to a set_(UnrelEv) temperature , I started_(UnrelEv) on making_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) my frosting .
 I broke_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the eggs and separated_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the yolks and the whites , and I set_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) up my flour in my pans .
 I then went_(UnrelEv) on to making_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) and mixing_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) my frosting and my batter in their respective bowls .
 The batter was finished_(ScrEv_make_dough) and then placed_(ScrEv_pour_dough) into the baking pan for about the next half hour .
 After the oven timer went_(ScrEv_other) off , I checked_(ScrEv_check) on the way the batter had risen_(RelNScrEv) and settled_(RelNScrEv) , and found_(UnrelEv) that my cake was_(UnrelEv) ready to be decorated_(ScrEv_decorate) with the frosting .
 This was meant_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) a birthday cake , so I bought_(ScrEv_get_ingredients) festive frosting add-ons to go_(UnrelEv) with my original homemade_(UnrelEv) frosting .
 I applied_(ScrEv_decorate) the homemade_(UnrelEv) frosting to the cake first , then squirted_(ScrEv_decorate) the store-bought_(UnrelEv) frosting onto the cake through the funnel .
 I wrote_(ScrEv_decorate) several words on the cake as well to make_(UnrelEv) it more personalized_(UnrelEv) for the person whom the birthday was happening_(UnrelEv) for .
 I also set_(UnrelEv) aside several candles for the birthday boy to blow_(UnrelEv) out later on .

 I got_(ScrEv_get_utensils) the largest bowl in my house and put_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) all of the dry ingredients in it .
 Then , in a separate bowl , I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) together all of the wet ingredients .
 Then i combined_(ScrEv_add_ingredients) the wet and dry ingredients into the large bowl , and began to beat_(ScrEv_make_dough) them until it was well blended_(ScrEv_make_dough) .
 I poured_(ScrEv_pour_dough) the cake batter into a cake pan and put_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) the cake in the oven for 30 minutes .

 We had_(ScrEv_eat) the cake after dinner and it was_(UnrelEv) a huge success !

 Baking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) cake_(Evoking) either for myself or for friends is_(UnrelEv) a fun activity .
 I first plan_(ScrEv_other) ahead , so I know_(UnrelEv) what kind of cake I will be making_(Evoking) and what supplies I will need_(UnrelEv) for that cake .
 I prepare_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) my pans , so the cake wo n't stick_(UnrelEv) to the sides or bottom and preheat_(ScrEv_preheat) my oven so that when my batter is mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) it can go_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) right into the oven .
 A simple cake will usually require_(UnrelEv) eggs , flower , baking powder and a few other things .
 Generally speaking_(UnrelEv) I will mix_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry in another before mixing_(ScrEv_make_dough) them together .
 I like to use_(UnrelEv) an industrial strength mixing bowl , as opposed_(UnrelEv) to a hand mixer .
 I make_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) that it is well mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) with no lumps , but not overly mixed_(ScrEv_make_dough) , as that can ruin_(UnrelEv) the_(UnrelEv) batter .
 Once the batter is_(UnrelEv) smooth and yummy I pour_(ScrEv_pour_dough) it into the prepared_(ScrEv_grease_cake_tin) pans and pop_(ScrEv_put_cake_oven) them in the over for about 20-30 minutes .

 I mixed_(ScrEv_prepare_ingredients) together the flour , cocoa powder , baking powder and baking soda .

 After packing_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) what I needed_(UnrelEv) , I took_(ScrEv_get_airport) the bus to the airport where I had to get_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my ticket , go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security , get_(UnrelEv) my suitcase checked_(ScrEv_check_luggage) , and find_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my way to the terminal to wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) until the called_(ScrEv_listen_call) for people to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) my flight .

 I needed to fly_(Evoking) out_(Evoking) to visit_(UnrelEv) my mom in another state , so I booked_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a flight on my favorite airline .
 When the day of the flight arrived_(UnrelEv) , I already had my bags packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) , because I plan_(UnrelEv) ahead and packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) them the previous night .
 Then it was_(UnrelEv) time to drive_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport .
 I parked_(UnrelEv) my car at a nearby parking garage , and took_(ScrEv_get_airport) a special bus called_(UnrelEv) a shuttle to the airport .
 I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) 2 hours early , because you want to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to have plenty of time to get_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through security .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_check_in) to_(ScrEv_go_check_in) the check in booth and gave_(RelNScrEv) them my information .
 I would have given_(ScrEv_check_luggage) them my larger luggage for them to put_(UnrelEv) on the plane right there , but I was traveling_(RelNScrEv) light so I only had_(UnrelEv) '' `` carry on '' '' luggage , which I got to bring_(UnrelEv) with me to my seat on the plane .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through the air port security , where I had to take_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) off_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my shoes and jacket and walk_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) a scanner .

 A few weeks ago , I flew_(Evoking) from_(Evoking) Indianapolis_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) New_(Evoking) York_(Evoking) .
 When I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport , I had_(UnrelEv) with me one suitcase and my purse , and I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) that my driver 's license and airplane ticket were_(RelNScrEv) handy in my purse .
 At the airport , I parked_(RelNScrEv) in the parking garage and made_(UnrelEv) a note about where my car was_(UnrelEv) so that I could find_(UnrelEv) it when I returned_(Unclear) .
 Then I walked_(ScrEv_get_airport) across the bridge from the parking garage to the airport terminal , where I went_(ScrEv_go_check_in) to_(ScrEv_go_check_in) the check-in desk for my airline , Delta .
 At the check-in desk , I gave_(ScrEv_check_in) my driver 's license and my plane ticket to the clerk , who checked_(ScrEv_check_in) them to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I was_(UnrelEv) who I said_(UnrelEv) I was_(UnrelEv) .
 She took_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my suitcase and gave_(ScrEv_check_luggage) me a claim ticket so that I could get_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) it back when I got_(ScrEv_landing) to New York .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security , where I had_(UnrelEv) to put_(RelNScrEv) my purse and coat and shoes into pins that would go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) an x-ray machine while I walked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) a metal detector .
 On the other side of the metal detector , I collected_(RelNScrEv) my belongings and then found_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the gate -LRB- that is_(UnrelEv) , the area where my particular plane would be loading_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) up_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) -RRB- .
 I sat_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) in a waiting_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) area at the gate until the airport attendant told_(ScrEv_listen_call) us it was_(UnrelEv) time to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 While I was waiting_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) , I used_(UnrelEv) my cell phone to let_(UnrelEv) my husband know_(UnrelEv) I had gotten_(ScrEv_get_airport) to_(ScrEv_get_airport) the airport safely , then I read_(RelNScrEv) a book for a while .
 When they called_(ScrEv_listen_call) us to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane , I got_(ScrEv_wait) in line and we walked_(ScrEv_board_plane) down_(ScrEv_board_plane) a long ramp to get_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 On the plane , we walked_(ScrEv_take_seat) back_(ScrEv_take_seat) to our assigned_(RelNScrEv) seats .
 I had_(ScrEv_take_seat) a seat next to the window .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very sunny , so I pulled_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) the shade on the window .
 The person sitting_(ScrEv_take_seat) next to me said_(UnrelEv) she was going to sleep_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) and that I should wake_(RelNScrEv) her up if she snored_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 In a few minutes , the plane started_(UnrelEv) taxiing_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) , that is_(UnrelEv) , driving_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) around_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) on the ground to get_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) up_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) speed .
 Then we took_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) and climbed_(ScrEv_take_off) up_(ScrEv_take_off) through the clouds .
 Once the plane was_(Unclear) above the clouds , I mostly looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the window , because I always enjoy_(UnrelEv) looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) at_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the clouds from above and catching_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) occasional glimpses of the ground below .
 During the flight , the attendants brought_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) us drinks , so I enjoyed_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a cup of coffee .
 The person next to me did snore_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a little , but it did n't bother_(UnrelEv) me , so I did n't wake_(RelNScrEv) her up .
 After about an hour and 15 minutes , we landed_(ScrEv_landing) in New York .

 Planes can be_(UnrelEv) crowded when one is getting_(Unclear) on or off , but we found_(RelNScrEv) our seats and buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) in .
 It took_(UnrelEv) a bit of time for everyone to settle_(ScrEv_take_seat) in_(ScrEv_take_seat) , but before long the plane was taxiing_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) down the runway .
 When the plane lifted_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) , I could feel_(UnrelEv) it tilt_(RelNScrEv) to one side and then right_(RelNScrEv) itself again .
 It was_(UnrelEv) fun looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out of the window and seeing_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the world below get_(UnrelEv) smaller and smaller , then disappear_(UnrelEv) as we climbed_(ScrEv_other) above the clouds .
 We both enjoyed_(UnrelEv) the plane ride a great deal .
 A flight attendant offered_(RelNScrEv) us drinks and snacks , and we had_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) some orange soda and complimentary peanuts .
 Soon the flight was_(UnrelEv) over , and it was time to disembark_(ScrEv_exit_plane) .

 Once I got_(ScrEv_get_airport) there , I went_(ScrEv_go_check_in) up to the counter to check_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my luggage .
 The lady working_(UnrelEv) at the counter was_(UnrelEv) very nice and told_(RelNScrEv) me where to go_(ScrEv_find_terminal) .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through a metal detector that security guards were monitoring_(UnrelEv) .
 I found_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my airplane terminal , and I patiently waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) while sitting_(UnrelEv) in a chair .
 Over the speakers , a voice told_(ScrEv_listen_call) passengers we could begin_(UnrelEv) boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 I got_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane and the ride took_(UnrelEv) about three hours .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a pretty simple experience .

 I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) in a seating area near the gate at the airport .
 I could see_(UnrelEv) the huge jetliner out the window .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) at my ticket and saw_(UnrelEv) that I was_(UnrelEv) in Group 3 .
 When the gate attendant called_(ScrEv_listen_call) my number I showed_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) her my ticket and boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) my seat , 22D , and sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down_(ScrEv_take_seat) , putting_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) the small bag I had packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) under the seat in front of me .
 After everyone was_(UnrelEv) on the plane they shut_(RelNScrEv) the door .
 The flight attendant made_(ScrEv_listen_crew) a few announcements and I buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) myself in .
 The plane pulled_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) away from the gate and taxied_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to a runway .
 We sat_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) on the runway for a few minutes before we were given_(UnrelEv) approval to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 I was pushed_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) in my seat and we accelerated_(ScrEv_take_off) down the runway .
 The nose lifted_(ScrEv_take_off) and we were_(UnrelEv) in the air .
 During the flight I got_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a drink .
 One hour later , the plane set_(ScrEv_landing) down_(ScrEv_landing) in Cleveland .
 Success !

 Two years ago was_(UnrelEv) my first and only airplane_(Evoking) flight_(Evoking) .
 I was moving_(UnrelEv) from the state of Kansas to the state of Washington , permanently .
 I had ordered_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my tickets three months in advance , with a little bit of hassle due to rescheduling_(RelNScrEv) -LRB- it was_(UnrelEv) free , thankfully , -RRB- and met_(RelNScrEv) with my parents at the airport .
 After they wished_(UnrelEv) me goodbye I took_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my luggage to the security area , got cleared_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) ten minutes in advance , and waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for my plane , listening_(ScrEv_listen_call) carefully for my number while I played_(UnrelEv) my Nintendo DS .
 After that , we were all filed_(ScrEv_board_plane) single line into my plane , and I took_(ScrEv_take_seat) a seat - it was_(UnrelEv) an open_(RelNScrEv) seated_(RelNScrEv) plane - and I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off !
 It was_(RelNScrEv) super shaky due to turbulence but the flight was_(UnrelEv) otherwise a very boring two hours - I fell_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) asleep several times waiting_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) for us to get_(RelNScrEv) there , and also ordered_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) soda and a few snacks .
 I was allowed_(UnrelEv) to play_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my games on the plane as long as it did n't use_(UnrelEv) any wireless networks , but they got_(UnrelEv) boring after a while .
 When I got_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off , I made_(UnrelEv) sure to grab_(ScrEv_other) my carry-on and meet_(ScrEv_meet_people) my ride to the new place at the Washington airport !

 When the day approaches_(UnrelEv) , I pack_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) carefully , excluding_(UnrelEv) oversized toiletries , liquids , explosives and anything else likely to be viewed_(RelNScrEv) as contraband .
 I also remind_(UnrelEv) myself not to joke_(UnrelEv) about this stuff at the airport , and to be_(UnrelEv) absolutely cooperative .
 I wear_(UnrelEv) slip-on shoes , arrive_(ScrEv_get_airport) an hour early , get_(ScrEv_wait) in line and do_(UnrelEv) as I am told_(UnrelEv) .
 Usually this means_(UnrelEv) a brief scan and luggage overlook_(ScrEv_check_luggage) .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) much like crossing_(UnrelEv) a border , and only slightly more intense .
 Then I wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) on the other side of the checkpoint , with everyone else .
 I am careful to bring_(RelNScrEv) snacks and slippers in my carry on luggage , and I read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) rather than paying_(RelNScrEv) for entertainment .

 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) in the airport until it was time for the passengers to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 I went_(ScrEv_board_plane) up with the other passengers and stood_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) in line .
 We all had to show_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) our boarding passes at the gate .
 Once we 'd done_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) that , we were allowed_(RelNScrEv) to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) a plane .
 We all walked_(ScrEv_get_plane) down a short hallway that connected_(RelNScrEv) the airport to the plane itself .
 As we walked_(ScrEv_board_plane) in the door of the plane , a stewardess and a pilot both said_(RelNScrEv) hello to us .
 I walked_(ScrEv_other) down the narrow aisle of the plane until I found_(RelNScrEv) my seat number , which was_(UnrelEv) near the plane 's right wing .
 I put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) the bag I was carrying_(UnrelEv) in an overhead compartment near my seat and sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down next to the window .
 Soon the plane was taxiing_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off , which means_(UnrelEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) essentially driving_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to the runway .
 Once there , the plane got_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) the go ahead to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 It started_(UnrelEv) going_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) really , really fast , and then suddenly it was_(ScrEv_take_off) off the ground and quickly gaining_(RelNScrEv) elevation .
 I looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out the window and saw_(UnrelEv) the airport and the neighborhood nearby , the streets and cars and fields all get_(UnrelEv) smaller and smaller , until they did n't look_(UnrelEv) real anymore .
 My flight lasted_(RelNScrEv) a few hours .
 During that time the stewardesses passed_(ScrEv_other) around sodas , and people who wanted_(UnrelEv) to eat_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) ordered_(RelNScrEv) things like bags of peanuts .
 I ate_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a granola bar I 'd taken_(UnrelEv) with me and watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) part of a movie that they were showing_(RelNScrEv) .
 Finally it was_(UnrelEv) time to land_(ScrEv_landing) .
 The plane started_(UnrelEv) to descend_(ScrEv_landing) , more and more .
 Finally its wheels touched_(RelNScrEv) the runway .
 It taxied_(ScrEv_landing) for a while and then finally came_(ScrEv_landing) to a stop .
 People got_(ScrEv_other) up and got_(ScrEv_other) their bags from the overhead compartments .
 The aisle was_(UnrelEv) very crowded_(RelNScrEv) at this point .
 When the doors were opened_(ScrEv_other) we all got_(ScrEv_exit_plane) out of the plane and made_(ScrEv_get_destination_airport) our way to the airport and , from there , to wherever we all were going_(UnrelEv) .

 When I was_(UnrelEv) a kid , my dad was_(UnrelEv) a licensed_(RelNScrEv) pilot and he had_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) small_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) .
 It seated_(RelNScrEv) 4 .
 He lived_(UnrelEv) in a small town about 2 hours by car north of the larger town when we kids lived_(UnrelEv) with our mom .
 We would go_(UnrelEv) visit_(UnrelEv) my dad every other weekend .
 My grandfather was_(RelNScrEv) a pilot too and had_(RelNScrEv) a small plane .
 His was_(UnrelEv) smaller , though , and only seated_(RelNScrEv) 2 people .
 It was_(UnrelEv) fun to fly_(RelNScrEv) in because I got_(UnrelEv) to sit_(ScrEv_take_seat) in front and see_(UnrelEv) out the front and watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) him work_(RelNScrEv) the controls .
 When we flew_(RelNScrEv) with my dad , my stepmother sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) in the front seat and all three of us kids sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) in the back seat .
 We were_(UnrelEv) small , so we all fit_(RelNScrEv) .
 There was_(UnrelEv) n't much room for luggage , but my dad would load_(RelNScrEv) the luggage behind the back seat .
 Then he would do_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) the preflight checks .
 Some of these were_(UnrelEv) outside the plane , but most of them were done_(UnrelEv) from the inside .
 He would radio_(ScrEv_other) the tower and ask_(RelNScrEv) for permission to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 This was_(UnrelEv) always very exciting_(UnrelEv) .
 The takeoff_(ScrEv_take_off) was_(UnrelEv) a little scary because in a plane that small you could really feel_(UnrelEv) the wind and the forces of the take_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 The flight itself was_(UnrelEv) fairly boring because you could n't really see_(UnrelEv) anything from the back .
 Sadly , I had_(UnrelEv) bad motion sickness , and my main memory of the landings_(ScrEv_landing) is throwing_(RelNScrEv) up down the back of my dad 's neck .

 Flying_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) for the first time can be_(UnrelEv) a wonderful experience .
 Once you are all settled_(ScrEv_take_seat) into your seat you will hear_(ScrEv_listen_crew) all the safety messages .

 During the safety briefing , the plane will be heading_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) towards the runaway for takeoff_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 Once the plane is_(UnrelEv) ready for takeoff_(ScrEv_take_off) , all the flight attendants will sit_(ScrEv_take_seat) and buckle_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) themselves in .
 Next comes_(UnrelEv) the best part - the plane will accelerate_(ScrEv_take_off) very quickly from sitting_(UnrelEv) to flying_(ScrEv_other) in the air .
 The process barely takes_(UnrelEv) a minute but you 'll feel_(UnrelEv) the rush from going so fast .

 I brought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my tickets a few months before , and when the day arrived_(UnrelEv) , I simply printed_(RelNScrEv) out the ticket from my computer .
 I brought_(RelNScrEv) my two suitcases filled_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) with clothes and necessities , along with my visa and other important travel documents .
 Once I got_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport , I passed_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) by security and they checked_(ScrEv_other) my bags for anything that was_(UnrelEv) illegal or dangerous .
 Once I got_(UnrelEv) past the checkpoint , I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) at a terminal for an hour .
 They began_(UnrelEv) to call for my plane and I got_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) on line .
 I gave_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) the lady my visa and ticket and I boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) the airplane .
 I put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) the luggage above my head in the luggage department and sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down .
 My seat was_(UnrelEv) next to a window so I was_(UnrelEv) very happy about that .
 Soon a person sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down next to me .
 We were told_(ScrEv_listen_crew) to eventually put_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seat belts on as we were_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) ready to fly_(RelNScrEv) .
 We watched_(RelNScrEv) a short video on what to do_(RelNScrEv) in case we felt_(RelNScrEv) some turbulence and what to do_(RelNScrEv) in case of emergency .
 Then the airplane lifted_(ScrEv_take_off) off and I was_(UnrelEv) scared_(RelNScrEv) at first , I felt_(UnrelEv) some shaking_(RelNScrEv) but eventually we were_(ScrEv_take_off) in the air and everything was_(UnrelEv) okay .
 Eventually they began to serve_(ScrEv_other) food .
 That was_(UnrelEv) my favorite part .
 I love_(UnrelEv) airplane food !

 I was headed_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) my cousin in Italy for a few weeks .
 The week before , my dad went_(UnrelEv) online and purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) me one of those convenient e-tickets .
 He printed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) it out and made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I remembered_(UnrelEv) to bring_(RelNScrEv) it on the day of my flight .
 We arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) early to the airport so that i could go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) all of the security checks .
 I had to take_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) my shoes and put_(RelNScrEv) my belongings in a tray as I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the scanner .
 After that , I saw_(RelNScrEv) the board with all of the flights and saw_(UnrelEv) that my flight was leaving_(ScrEv_take_off) soon .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) a few minutes by the gate with my parents until it was_(UnrelEv) time to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 Many passengers climbed_(ScrEv_board_plane) aboard_(ScrEv_board_plane) and found_(ScrEv_take_seat) their seats .
 The captain greeted_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us over the loudspeaker and then the plane took_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 I was_(UnrelEv) tired so I took_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a nap .
 When I woke_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) up_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) I could see_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the clouds around me as we were_(RelNScrEv) pretty high up in the air .
 After a few more hours we arrived_(ScrEv_landing) and everyone clapped_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .

 For my first time flying_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) I ca n't say_(UnrelEv) that I was too scared_(UnrelEv) .
 I mean_(UnrelEv) what could be_(UnrelEv) so scary about being_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) .
 I was pumped_(UnrelEv) and ready for my first flight .
 But first things first , I had to pack_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) my suitcase .
 With this finished_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) and my plane ticket purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) online -LRB- boy that 's_(UnrelEv) convenient -RRB- I began_(UnrelEv) the long wait for departure day .
 When It came_(UnrelEv) I rushed_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport in my car , maybe a little too fast according_(UnrelEv) to the driver who honked_(UnrelEv) and put_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) a very rude message with one of his fingers .
 Whatever , nothing can deter_(UnrelEv) me from this flight .
 I arrive_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport and get_(UnrelEv) processed_(ScrEv_check_in) .
 I jump_(ScrEv_board_plane) on my plane and wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for departure .
 This is_(UnrelEv) the moment I 've been waiting_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) .
 And then we set_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 And once I look_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the window I am terrified_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) , I should have never done_(Evoking) this .
 The flight takes_(Unclear) a couple hours and then I am_(UnrelEv) good .
 But I realized_(UnrelEv) one thing .
 Plane 's are actually terrifying_(UnrelEv) .

 I 'm_(UnrelEv) so excited for my trip to Florida !
 It 's going to be_(UnrelEv) warm and I 'm looking_(UnrelEv) forward_(UnrelEv) to visiting Disney World .
 The most exciting part will be_(UnrelEv) the plane ride .
 When I arrive_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport , I get_(ScrEv_go_check_in) into_(ScrEv_go_check_in) the check in line .
 I show_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) the woman at the counter my ticket .
 She asks_(RelNScrEv) to see either my driver 's license or a passport .
 I hand_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) her my passport .
 She asks_(RelNScrEv) me how many suitcases I will be brining_(UnrelEv) with me .
 I tell_(RelNScrEv) her two .
 She prints_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) stickers to put_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) my bags so that they know_(UnrelEv) which plane to put_(UnrelEv) my bags on .
 Next , she prints_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) my boarding pass .
 I will need_(UnrelEv) this to be able to get_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto the plane .
 She tells_(RelNScrEv) me that my plane will be leaving_(ScrEv_take_off) from Gate A7 .
 I follow_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the signs that point_(UnrelEv) towards Gate A7 .
 Before I can enter_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the '' `` A '' '' terminal , I must go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) a security check point .
 I take_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) a plastic bin and place_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) all my loose belongings in there - like my backpack , keys and cell phone .
 I also must remove_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my shoes and place_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) them in a bin .
 The bins run_(UnrelEv) along a conveyor belt and into an x-ray machine .
 People monitor_(UnrelEv) the x-ray machine to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) there is nothing dangerous in my belongings .
 A man waves_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) at me to walk_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) a metal detector .
 It does n't hurt_(UnrelEv) .
 It 's just like walking_(UnrelEv) through an open door .
 After I am cleared_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) at security , I collect_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my bags and head_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the gate .
 Thirty minutes later , my plane has arrived_(RelNScrEv) and an airline employee announces_(ScrEv_listen_call) that we will be boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 The plane boards_(ScrEv_board_plane) according to what row you are seated_(UnrelEv) in .
 Luckily , I 'm_(UnrelEv) in row one so I get to go_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane first !
 After everyone is seated_(ScrEv_take_seat) and their carry on bags are either placed_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) in the upper storage bins or under out seats , the flight attendant announces_(ScrEv_listen_crew) we are ready to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) !
 I buckle_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seatbelt and then the plane slowly taxis_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to the runway .
 The friendly flight attendant talks_(ScrEv_listen_crew) about safety procedures while we are driving_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to the runway .
 Within two minutes , the plane starts moving_(ScrEv_take_off) faster and faster and before I know_(UnrelEv) it , we are_(UnrelEv) up in the air !
 Two of the flight attendants come_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) and offer_(RelNScrEv) me a drink and a snack .
 I choose_(RelNScrEv) a Diet Coke and some pretzels .
 While flying_(ScrEv_other) , I totally forget_(UnrelEv) I 'm up in the air .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) a bit noisy , as if riding_(UnrelEv) in a train , but I forget_(UnrelEv) we are_(UnrelEv) n't on the ground ... until I look_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) outside and see the clouds passing_(UnrelEv) by_(UnrelEv) .
 The pilot comes_(ScrEv_listen_crew) on the PA system a few times to announce_(ScrEv_listen_crew) things like cruising altitude and the current weather temperature in Florida .
 About two and half hours after take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) , the pilot asks_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us to prepare_(UnrelEv) for landing_(ScrEv_landing) .
 We have to put_(RelNScrEv) our seats upright and make_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) we are buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) in_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) .
 I can feel_(UnrelEv) the plane slowly descending_(ScrEv_landing) .
 My ears feel_(UnrelEv) a bit uncomfortable from the change in air pressure .
 I can see_(UnrelEv) houses and trees getting_(UnrelEv) closer .
 The plane bumps_(RelNScrEv) once when the landing gear touches_(ScrEv_landing) the ground .
 We roll_(ScrEv_landing) smoothly to the end of the runway and then taxi_(RelNScrEv) over to the gate .
 I gather_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) my belongings and thank_(RelNScrEv) the flight crew for a wonderful flight .
 I ca n't wait_(UnrelEv) to start_(UnrelEv) my vacation !

 Last month I went_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) to Mexico .
 I was_(UnrelEv) excited_(UnrelEv) because I had never been_(UnrelEv) to Mexico or flown_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) before and I was going to get_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) both .
 I booked_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my flight months in advance to be_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I would have_(Unclear) transportation_(Unclear) to my vacation destination .

 A nice lady checked_(ScrEv_check_in) my ticket and confirmed_(ScrEv_listen_crew) that my flight was_(UnrelEv) on schedule .
 I then proceeded_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to the security check station where officers checked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my bags and personal belongings .
 After the quick screening_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) and a short wait my plane boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 I found_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat next to the window and was_(UnrelEv) full of excitement .
 After some short instructions the plane taxied_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) the runway and then sped_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) up_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) in a flash .

 Last year I went_(UnrelEv) to visit_(RelNScrEv) my cousins in California .
 Since I live_(UnrelEv) in New York , I had to fly_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) to get there .
 I purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a ticket at the ticket counter and then went_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to the gate where I would get_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto the airplane .
 I listened_(ScrEv_listen_call) carefully for the announcement that boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) would begin and was_(UnrelEv) first in line to get_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 Once I was_(UnrelEv) on the plane , I put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my suitcase in the overhead compartment and found_(RelNScrEv) my seat .
 I had chosen_(RelNScrEv) a seat near the window so that I could easily see_(RelNScrEv) the clouds and the cities below me .
 I sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down_(ScrEv_take_seat) and put_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seat belt on .
 Before the flight could take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) a flight attendant had to give_(ScrEv_listen_crew) some important safety instructions .
 I listened_(ScrEv_listen_crew) carefully so that I would know_(UnrelEv) what to do_(UnrelEv) in an emergency .

 I was_(UnrelEv) surprised by how loud the engines were_(UnrelEv) when the plane started moving_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) .

 Last summer I decided_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) a fantastic idea to visit_(RelNScrEv) my friend on the other side of the country .
 Normally I might drive_(UnrelEv) , as I do n't mind_(UnrelEv) driving_(UnrelEv) , but I was_(UnrelEv) on a tight schedule with work and needed to keep_(UnrelEv) the trip short .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) I needed to fly_(Evoking) .
 I visited_(RelNScrEv) an airline price comparing website , and ultimately chose_(UnrelEv) to book_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a flight from Charlotte where I lived_(UnrelEv) to San Francisco where my friend lived_(UnrelEv) .
 The airline was_(UnrelEv) a well known carrier , American , and the round trip fare was_(UnrelEv) phenomenal at only $ 150 .
 What a deal !
 After I booked_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the flight , I was emailed_(RelNScrEv) a boarding pass to print_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 The day of the flight I brought_(RelNScrEv) my luggage and boarding pass with me to the airport .
 Inside the airport , I visited_(ScrEv_go_check_in) the ticket counter to present_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) my boarding pass and luggage .
 My luggage was checked-in_(ScrEv_check_luggage) for a small fee , leaving_(UnrelEv) me free to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane without having to carry_(UnrelEv) the burden of all that weight .
 I had to wait_(ScrEv_wait) through a security line and get checked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) for illegal items before proceeding_(RelNScrEv) to the gate .
 This process took_(UnrelEv) about 20 minutes .
 Once at the gate I showed_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) my boarding pass again and walked_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto the plane .
 I was directed_(RelNScrEv) towards my assigned_(UnrelEv) seat in the economy class cabin .
 After a few more minutes the plane pushed_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) back_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) and began taxiing_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to the runway .
 During this time other passengers and myself were instructed_(ScrEv_listen_crew) to buckle_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seat belts and watch_(ScrEv_listen_crew) a safety demonstration on what to do_(UnrelEv) in the event of an in-flight emergency .
 We then took_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) , climbed_(ScrEv_other) to about 34,000 feet , and roamed_(ScrEv_other) the skies westward .
 I slept_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) for the remainder of the flight .
 Upon waking_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the plane was just touching_(ScrEv_landing) down_(ScrEv_landing) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a very quick flight , only 5 hours .
 I stepped_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off the plane and walked_(UnrelEv) to baggage pickup .
 When my bags came_(RelNScrEv) around the belt , I picked_(RelNScrEv) them up and walked_(ScrEv_leave_airport) outside , where my friend was waiting_(RelNScrEv) for me .
 All in all it was_(UnrelEv) a fun and painless journey .
 I would definitely do_(UnrelEv) it again .

 I find_(UnrelEv) that it is_(UnrelEv) cheaper to do_(ScrEv_get_ticket) it at least two weeks ahead of time for the best price .
 Within a week of my flight I prepare_(UnrelEv) by packing_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) my clothes and any other necessary items in a maximum of two bags .

 Once I am_(ScrEv_get_airport) at_(ScrEv_get_airport) the airport I park_(RelNScrEv) , then bring_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my luggage through checkout and confirm_(ScrEv_check_in) and receive_(ScrEv_check_in) my ticket .
 After checkout I get checked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) by security .
 Afterwards I go_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my gate and wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for my plane to load_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) when they call_(ScrEv_listen_call) my seat section listed_(UnrelEv) on my flight ticket .
 Once in the plane , I either sleep_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) , read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a book , or listen_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) to_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) music when the pilot okays_(ScrEv_listen_crew) it .

 '' Before you board_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) you should consider_(UnrelEv) picking_(RelNScrEv) up a bottle of water and a snack in case they do n't have_(UnrelEv) anything you 'd like_(UnrelEv) to drink_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) or eat_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) on the flight .

 Flying_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) is necessary to travel_(RelNScrEv) to far away destinations that are_(UnrelEv) not easily accessible by other modes of transportation .
 Last summer , I had_(UnrelEv) a girls trip to the Carribean .

 We arrive_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport a few hours beforehand for an international flight .
 We all pack_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) lightly with one piece of luggage .

 I love_(UnrelEv) the sound of the big metal bird racing_(RelNScrEv) off the runway .

 I ' ve met_(UnrelEv) many people traveling_(UnrelEv) from different places on the globe .

 I love_(UnrelEv) the safety show the flight attendants put_(ScrEv_other) on in case there ' s_(RelNScrEv) an emergency .
 However , I hate_(UnrelEv) turbulence because it sounds_(RelNScrEv) like the plane is banging_(RelNScrEv) into other planes in the sky .

 I had_(RelNScrEv) a seat to myself .

 She had been_(UnrelEv) very sick and in the hospital for awhile now so I owed_(UnrelEv) it to her .
 I would have taken_(UnrelEv) the bus but it was_(UnrelEv) at least a twenty four hour journey if driving_(UnrelEv) .
 I searched_(RelNScrEv) some popular sites online and found_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the perfect flight deal .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a round trip flight from New York to Orlando and it would only take_(RelNScrEv) four hours .
 I was scheduled_(UnrelEv) to leave_(ScrEv_take_off) the following_(UnrelEv) morning so I packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) just enough stuff to fit_(UnrelEv) on a carryon bag .
 The airline charged_(RelNScrEv) extra money based_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) how many bags you had_(UnrelEv) .
 Carry ons were_(UnrelEv) free and I was only staying_(UnrelEv) for two days so things worked_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) great .
 I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) and the busy airport an hour long , went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the security part which took_(UnrelEv) the longest .
 I had_(UnrelEv) just minutes before my flight would board_(ScrEv_board_plane) and my nerves were getting_(RelNScrEv) the best of me .
 But once I got_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) things were_(UnrelEv) great .
 I had_(ScrEv_take_seat) a window seat but never looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) to see_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the clouds .
 The flight attendants were_(UnrelEv) great and offered_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) me drinks and snacks .
 My ears rang_(RelNScrEv) a little but the gum I chewed_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) helped_(RelNScrEv) .
 There was_(RelNScrEv) n't any turbulence and I was_(Unclear) by my grandmothers side before I knew_(UnrelEv) it .
 So glad to have been able to overcome_(UnrelEv) my fears .

 After a couple days from ordering_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the plane tickets online .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_airport) over to the airport which took_(UnrelEv) about 45 minutes .
 Upon arriving_(UnrelEv) there I parked_(ScrEv_other) my car and walked_(ScrEv_get_airport) inside the airport .
 I had to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through security first which checked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) everything , and I walked_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to find the wing where my assigned_(RelNScrEv) airplane was at .
 Once I found_(ScrEv_find_terminal) it , I drop_(ScrEv_other) off my luggage and go_(UnrelEv) to the clerk with my plane ticket .
 After she inspects_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) it , I go_(ScrEv_board_plane) on the airplane and sit_(ScrEv_take_seat) onto my assigned_(RelNScrEv) seat .
 Since this was_(UnrelEv) my first ride , I decided_(UnrelEv) to not sit_(UnrelEv) near the window in order to prevent_(UnrelEv) getting_(RelNScrEv) sick .
 After the plane filled_(RelNScrEv) up with more people , we ended_(UnrelEv) up taking_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 During the ride everyone was_(UnrelEv) very quite and there was_(UnrelEv) a movie playing_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) during the ride .
 After 2 hours the plane arrived_(ScrEv_get_destination_airport) to the next airport and I got_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off .
 I picked_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) up my luggage , and met_(ScrEv_meet_people) up with my friend who met_(ScrEv_meet_people) me there .

 Flying_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) pretty easy , provided_(UnrelEv) that I 've made_(Unclear) it through the airport easily .
 All of the security can take_(RelNScrEv) a while , but finally boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) the place makes_(UnrelEv) it worth it .
 I usually try_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_take_seat) a window seat , since I can sit_(ScrEv_take_seat) still for the hour or so it takes_(RelNScrEv) me to get_(RelNScrEv) to_(RelNScrEv) the state that my parents live_(UnrelEv) in_(UnrelEv) , and I do not like having_(UnrelEv) someone needing to slide_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) by_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) me every ten minutes or so .
 Once I 'm seated_(ScrEv_take_seat) , I 'll listed_(ScrEv_listen_crew) to_(ScrEv_listen_crew) the stewardess explain_(ScrEv_listen_crew) how the seat belt works_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) and the other safety instructions as the plane takes_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 It can be_(UnrelEv) a little bumpy at first , but I usually take_(RelNScrEv) a motion sickness pill before getting_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) so it does n't bother_(UnrelEv) me that much .
 Then I spend_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the flight listening_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) to_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) music , reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) something on my Nook , or playing_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a game on my DS .
 Flying_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) can be_(UnrelEv) pretty relaxing_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) when I just tune_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) everyone else out .
 Plus , I get_(UnrelEv) to watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the clouds out of the window too .

 With a yawn I realized_(UnrelEv) why I was_(UnrelEv) so tired .
 I had flown_(Evoking) home yesterday .
 and it was_(UnrelEv) a very long flight .
 I had purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my ticket online , so I only had to check-in_(ScrEv_check_in) when I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport .
 The took_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my bag at that time , and I walked_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) to the security gate .
 I was_(UnrelEv) really happy I had remembered_(UnrelEv) to wear slip on , sensible shoes , and easy fit clothing .
 I placed_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my purse and shoes in the bucket to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the scanner , and stepped_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) a scanner of my own .
 Sometimes that is all it takes_(UnrelEv) , but I was tapped_(UnrelEv) on the shoulder , and pulled_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) aside_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) for a random search .
 This didnt upset_(UnrelEv) me though , it happens_(UnrelEv) , although with more frequency than I would like_(UnrelEv) .
 A few moments of pat_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) down_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) , and I was putting_(RelNScrEv) my shoes back on .
 Taking_(RelNScrEv) my purse I headed_(ScrEv_find_terminal) for the gate listed_(UnrelEv) on my boarding pass .
 Near the gate was_(UnrelEv) a small shop .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to buy_(UnrelEv) a bottle of water , and a magazine to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) on the plane .
 I heard_(ScrEv_listen_call) an announcement that my plane was beginning to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) , so I paid_(UnrelEv) quickly , and joined_(UnrelEv) the line at the gate .
 They checked_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) my boarding pass as I reached_(UnrelEv) the head of the line , and now I was headed_(ScrEv_get_plane) down a small hallway to the plane .
 I could hear_(UnrelEv) the whine of engines as I went_(ScrEv_board_plane) through_(ScrEv_board_plane) the entry door .
 The airline personnel smiled_(UnrelEv) and greeted_(RelNScrEv) me , checked_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) my boarding pass , and gave_(UnrelEv) me a general idea of where to find_(RelNScrEv) my seat .
 It wasnt long before they closed_(UnrelEv) the door , and they were giving_(ScrEv_listen_crew) safety instructions .
 I listened_(ScrEv_listen_crew) closely , reading_(RelNScrEv) along on the safety card , and smiled_(UnrelEv) remembering_(UnrelEv) my first airline flight .
 I had been_(UnrelEv) 3 , and could not read_(UnrelEv) yet .
 I leaned_(UnrelEv) my head back , as the plane taxi_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) 'd , then sped_(ScrEv_take_off) down the runway for takeoff_(ScrEv_take_off) .

 Last summer I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) to Mexico with my cousins .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a nice vacation and we were very excited_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) .
 In order to get_(UnrelEv) to Mexico , we had to fly_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) .
 I have_(UnrelEv) no issues flying_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) .
 I usually fly_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) constantly when I visit_(UnrelEv) my friends in Florida .
 My cousins , on the other hand , were_(UnrelEv) n't too keen on flying_(Evoking) .
 They were_(UnrelEv) very nervous on the plane .
 I had to calm_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) them down .
 The food we received_(RelNScrEv) helped_(UnrelEv) calm_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) their nerves .
 Eating_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) distracted_(RelNScrEv) them a little from our environment .
 Everything was_(UnrelEv) fine until the plane started_(UnrelEv) to experience_(RelNScrEv) a lot of turbulence .
 My cousins started_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) afraid_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) again .
 In fact , the turbulence was_(UnrelEv) so bad , I started_(UnrelEv) to feel_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) afraid as well .
 Soon , the pilot announced_(ScrEv_listen_crew) that there was_(UnrelEv) nothing to worry_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) about_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 A couple minutes later , the plane flew_(Unclear) smoothly again .
 Eight hours later , we arrived_(ScrEv_landing) at Mexico .
 We were not only excited_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) in Mexico , but we were excited_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) on solid ground again .

 Some people view_(UnrelEv) flying_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) as a chore , but I truly enjoy_(UnrelEv) it .
 Finding_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the best fare and route to meet_(UnrelEv) your needs is a very important first step , and I usually utilize_(UnrelEv) various travel websites to ensure_(UnrelEv) I 'm getting_(UnrelEv) the best possible deal .
 On the day of my flight I go_(ScrEv_get_airport) to_(ScrEv_get_airport) the airport with plenty of time to check_(ScrEv_check_luggage) in_(ScrEv_check_luggage) luggage and get_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security checks .
 Having traveled_(RelNScrEv) before , I know_(UnrelEv) this can be_(UnrelEv) quite time consuming , so I try to be_(UnrelEv) there at least an hour and a half before boarding time .
 Once I 'm_(UnrelEv) through security I head_(ScrEv_find_terminal) towards my gate .
 If I have_(UnrelEv) time I may stop_(UnrelEv) for a snack or some shopping_(RelNScrEv) , though I make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to keep_(ScrEv_listen_call) an ear out for my flight to be called_(ScrEv_listen_call) for boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 Once I am called_(ScrEv_listen_call) , I patiently and orderly wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) my turn to enter_(ScrEv_board_plane) the airplane .
 I place_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my carry on in the assigned_(RelNScrEv) bin , take_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat , get_(RelNScrEv) a book out and make_(UnrelEv) myself as comfortable as possible .
 If I 'm correctly prepared_(RelNScrEv) , flying_(Evoking) can be_(UnrelEv) a wholly pleasant experience .

 Last week , I decided_(UnrelEv) to travel_(RelNScrEv) to see_(UnrelEv) my brother .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport with my luggage and checked_(ScrEv_go_check_in) in_(ScrEv_go_check_in) with the airline , where I received_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my ticket from the clerk .
 My luggage was weighed_(ScrEv_check_luggage) and tagged_(ScrEv_check_luggage) and I gave_(ScrEv_check_luggage) it to the clerk .
 I proceeded_(UnrelEv) upstairs with my ticket and waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) airport security .
 Once I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the security checkpoint , I located_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the concourse area and gate where my flight was to depart_(ScrEv_take_off) from .
 I sat_(UnrelEv) and waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) until my flight was boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 I then got_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) and waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line to get_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) the airplane .

 Once I was_(UnrelEv) on the plane , I located_(RelNScrEv) my seat and sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down_(ScrEv_take_seat) .
 I then buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seat belt and took_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) a book to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) during the flight .
 As the plane prepared_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) , the flight attendant went_(ScrEv_listen_crew) over_(ScrEv_listen_crew) all of the emergency procedures .
 Once the plane was flying_(ScrEv_other) in the air , the flight attendant asked_(RelNScrEv) me if I wanted_(UnrelEv) a beverage .
 I choose_(RelNScrEv) to have_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a cup of orange juice and was also given_(RelNScrEv) a bag of pretzels as a snack .
 I continued_(UnrelEv) to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my book with my seat belt on until the Captain of the flight came_(ScrEv_listen_crew) over the loud speaker and said_(ScrEv_listen_crew) that we were approaching_(ScrEv_other) our destination .
 The plane landed_(ScrEv_landing) and I put_(UnrelEv) my book away .
 When I got_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off_(ScrEv_exit_plane) of the plane , my brother was waiting_(UnrelEv) for me at the gate .

 I was planning_(UnrelEv) a relaxing_(UnrelEv) vacation at the beach .
 There was_(UnrelEv) only one problem : I did n't live_(UnrelEv) anywhere near a beach !
 Driving_(UnrelEv) to one in a car would take_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) too much of my fun vacation time .
 I had to buy_(ScrEv_get_ticket) tickets for an airplane ride , which would take_(RelNScrEv) much less time because airplanes go_(UnrelEv) very fast .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) to the website of my local airport and found_(RelNScrEv) the available planes_(Evoking) traveling_(Evoking) to the city where I wanted_(UnrelEv) to go_(Unclear) at the time I was going_(UnrelEv) on vacation and bought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a ticket .
 The planes were_(UnrelEv) ready to fly_(Evoking) only at certain times .
 When it came_(UnrelEv) time to go_(Unclear) on my trip , I packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) up_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) my suitcases , drove_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport before my plane was_(UnrelEv) ready to fly_(ScrEv_take_off) , and parked_(UnrelEv) my car .
 Inside the airport , I had to go_(ScrEv_wait) through_(ScrEv_wait) a long line for security , so that they can make_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) sure_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) there are_(UnrelEv) no dangerous items being taken_(Unclear) on_(Unclear) the plane .
 The workers looked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) inside_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my suitcases with an X-Ray machine and checked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the clothing I was wearing_(UnrelEv) to make_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) I was_(UnrelEv) safe , too .
 When I was all done_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) in security , I had to find_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the gate for my plane , where it would be_(UnrelEv) ready to pick_(ScrEv_board_plane) me and other passengers up .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) time to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane , the stewardess helped_(RelNScrEv) me find_(ScrEv_take_seat) my assigned_(UnrelEv) seat and put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my suitcase in the compartment above me .
 I buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seat belt and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the plane to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 When all the passengers were_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) board_(ScrEv_board_plane) , the stewardess explained_(ScrEv_listen_crew) what to do_(RelNScrEv) in an emergency , and the plane began_(UnrelEv) to move_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 It became_(RelNScrEv) very noisy and all of a sudden , outside the window , I could see_(UnrelEv) the ground get_(RelNScrEv) farther away .
 I felt_(UnrelEv) like my body was being pushed_(RelNScrEv) against my seat a little bit .
 After a few minutes , the plane stopped_(UnrelEv) going_(ScrEv_take_off) up_(ScrEv_take_off) and the stewardess told_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us we could take_(ScrEv_other) our seat belts off .
 She offered_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) us drinks from a cart , and I was able_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a book I brought_(UnrelEv) on the plane .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) the ride would last_(Unclear) a fair amount of time , so I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I had something to do_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 After a few hours , the captain explained_(ScrEv_listen_crew) on the intercom that we were arriving_(ScrEv_landing) in the city .
 He told_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us to buckle_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seat belts again , and the plane gently came_(ScrEv_landing) closer_(ScrEv_landing) to the ground .

 I flew_(Evoking) from_(Evoking) Amsterdam_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) New_(Evoking) York_(Evoking) City_(Evoking) last week .
 I had purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) and reserved_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my ticket a week in advance .
 I left_(UnrelEv) the hostel I was staying_(UnrelEv) and arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at Schiphol Airport at about 21:00 .
 After waiting_(ScrEv_wait) about 2 hours for the flight check-in_(ScrEv_check_in) , I boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 I went_(ScrEv_other) to and found_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat , located_(UnrelEv) on the left-hand side near the middle of the plane .
 I placed_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) some of my hand luggage in an overhead compartment and sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down next to another passenger who was seated_(RelNScrEv) to my right .
 I watched_(UnrelEv) the rest of remaining passengers who were heading_(UnrelEv) to their seats .
 About 20 minutes later , once everyone was seated_(RelNScrEv) and were given_(ScrEv_listen_crew) basic safety instructions by the flight attendants , the pilot announced_(ScrEv_listen_crew) that the we were now going to take_(RelNScrEv) off for New York .

 It was_(UnrelEv) a evening flight , so I slept_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) on and off for a little while , then began_(UnrelEv) watching_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) an in-flight movie .

 Then you have to check_(ScrEv_check_luggage) your luggage .
 After that , you have to go_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to the terminal and provide_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) proof of a ticket .
 Once you get_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) an airplane , you have to prepare_(UnrelEv) for turbulence .

 The first time I ever flew_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) last summer .
 My mother and I bought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) tickets and had_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) direct_(Evoking) flight_(Evoking) from Illinois to Virginia to see_(UnrelEv) my sister .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) cool to see_(UnrelEv) what this was_(UnrelEv) like since I always wanted_(UnrelEv) to walk_(UnrelEv) through an airport .
 So in the 21 years I have been_(UnrelEv) alive , I have only flown_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) twice .
 We walked_(ScrEv_get_airport) into the airport and went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security and waiting_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) by the section where we would board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 Then we boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) when the flight attendants said_(ScrEv_listen_call) the plane was_(Unclear) ready .
 We put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) our luggage under our seats and fastened_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seat belts .
 The flight attendants spoke_(ScrEv_listen_crew) to everyone on the plane and told_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us the safety procedures and rules for being_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) .
 We were then towed_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) out_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to the runway and the plane took_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) a smooth ride , but boy was_(UnrelEv) I wrong !
 The plane was_(RelNScrEv) so bumpy taking_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) and the plane was_(RelNScrEv) loud .
 Then we landed_(ScrEv_landing) 4 hours later and undid_(ScrEv_other) the seat belts and grabbed_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) out stuff and we walked_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane and out of the airport .
 I enjoyed_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the ride and it was_(UnrelEv) so cool flying_(Evoking) thought_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) clouds_(Evoking) and being_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) so high .

 I parked_(UnrelEv) my car at the airport parking lot .
 I boarded_(RelNScrEv) a shuttle bus that took_(ScrEv_get_airport) me to the airline departures .
 I headed_(ScrEv_get_airport) in the airport with my suitcase .
 Found_(UnrelEv) the proper line for my airline , and stood_(ScrEv_wait) in line waiting_(ScrEv_wait) with a lot of other passengers .
 When I got_(ScrEv_go_check_in) up to the desk , I checked_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my luggage in and was given_(ScrEv_other) a boarding pass for my flight .
 I then walked_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) to the security line to get_(ScrEv_find_terminal) into_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the airport terminal .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line for a long time .
 I showed_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) a TSA agent my driver 's license and boarding pass .
 I then had to take_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) off_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my shoes and put_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) all my belongings on a belt to be x-rayed_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) .
 Then I walked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through a metal detector and the TSA agent motioned_(UnrelEv) for me to move_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) .
 I gathered_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) my belongings , put_(UnrelEv) my shoes back on and found_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my gate .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) with the other passengers until it was_(UnrelEv) time to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the airplane .
 We then walked_(ScrEv_get_plane) in a line through the doors , down a long hallway , and into the airplane .
 On the airplane I found_(RelNScrEv) my seat .
 The airplane taxied_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) down the runway and took_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 After a long while , the flight attendant passed_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) beverages and snacks to everyone .
 I drank_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my beverage , ate_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my snack and fell_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) asleep_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 When I woke_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) up_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) we were landing_(ScrEv_landing) .
 We had to taxi_(RelNScrEv) down the runway and wait_(RelNScrEv) until a gate was_(UnrelEv) available .
 Once the airplane had stopped_(RelNScrEv) , the signal came_(RelNScrEv) on_(RelNScrEv) that we could take_(RelNScrEv) our seat belts off and get_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) .
 The doors open_(RelNScrEv) and we all exited_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off the plane .

 My wife and I flew_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) a couple of months ago .
 We were going_(Unclear) to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting_(UnrelEv) married_(UnrelEv) .
 He lives_(UnrelEv) there and said_(UnrelEv) that he would pick_(ScrEv_go_target_location) us up from the airport .
 But , the weather here was_(UnrelEv) cold and there was_(UnrelEv) freezing rain , so our flight was delayed_(RelNScrEv) for two hours .
 It was_(UnrelEv) kind of scary taking_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) because the weather was_(UnrelEv) still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting_(RelNScrEv) there waiting_(ScrEv_wait) , I was_(UnrelEv) ready to go_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 People on the flight were_(UnrelEv) pretty happy to finally leave_(ScrEv_take_off) and a lot of people were having_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) drinks .
 Everyone was getting_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) ready for their own little party in Las Vegas .
 The flight itself took_(RelNScrEv) a little over four hours due to the fact that we had_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) non-stop_(Evoking) flight_(Evoking) .
 I was_(UnrelEv) glad I paid_(RelNScrEv) the extra money for not making_(RelNScrEv) any stops .
 Six hours sitting_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) on an airplane is_(UnrelEv) more than enough for me .
 The flight was_(UnrelEv) pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was_(UnrelEv) a good thing , especially since my wife hates_(UnrelEv) to fly_(Evoking) .
 My friend ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) still picking_(ScrEv_go_target_location) us up from the airport and we had_(UnrelEv) a great time in Las Vegas .

 After boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) my plane and placing_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) the luggage in the luggage compartment overhead , I took_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat in my coach section of the airplane .
 I luckily had_(ScrEv_take_seat) the window seat , meaning_(UnrelEv) I had_(UnrelEv) slightly more room than the two strangers next to me on my right .
 I was able_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) fold_(RelNScrEv) back_(RelNScrEv) my seat a little bit to allow_(UnrelEv) for myself to rest_(RelNScrEv) my head and back from a rather long drive .
 I pulled_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my book and started_(UnrelEv) reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) as the plane took_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 About ten minutes into the flight , I decided_(UnrelEv) taking_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a little nap would be_(UnrelEv) appropriate and helpful during the five-hour-long flight .
 I fell_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) asleep_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) for about an hour and continued_(UnrelEv) to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my book .
 After my eyes got_(UnrelEv) tired_(UnrelEv) of reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) , I pulled_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) on_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the headphones and watching_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the movie being shown_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) in front of all the passengers .
 The movie ended_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) moments before we started_(UnrelEv) landing_(ScrEv_landing) , where I would then grab_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) my belongings and head_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane .

 Last summer , I decided_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) my friend Emily .
 She lives_(UnrelEv) very far from me : I live_(UnrelEv) in the middle of the country , and she lives_(UnrelEv) on the coast .
 So , I had_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) by flying_(Evoking) there_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) .
 I got_(UnrelEv) up very early in the morning so that I could drive_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport - it was_(UnrelEv) still dark outside when I left_(UnrelEv) my house .
 I parked_(RelNScrEv) in the lot , picked_(UnrelEv) up my duffle bag and slung_(UnrelEv) it across my shoulders , and walked_(ScrEv_get_airport) into the airport .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_check_in) to the ticket counter to check_(ScrEv_check_in) in at one of the kiosks , so that the airline knew_(UnrelEv) I would be flying_(Evoking) that day , and then I had to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through the security line .
 I was flying_(RelNScrEv) on a weekday , so the line was_(ScrEv_wait) very long with people who were flying_(RelNScrEv) for work , even though it was_(UnrelEv) still early in the morning .
 I checked_(UnrelEv) my email while I waited_(ScrEv_wait) , sent_(ScrEv_other) my bags through the x-ray machine , and finally stepped_(ScrEv_find_terminal) out into the main terminal of the airport .
 It was_(UnrelEv) bright and sunny , with lots of people rushing_(UnrelEv) everywhere .
 I walked_(ScrEv_find_terminal) over to my gate , and waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for my section of the plane to be called_(ScrEv_listen_call) to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 The flight crew got_(UnrelEv) to my section , and I walked_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto my plane , being_(UnrelEv) careful to hold_(RelNScrEv) my bags so that they would n't bump_(RelNScrEv) into the people who were already sitting_(RelNScrEv) down .
 I put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my luggage in the overhead compartments and made_(UnrelEv) sure it was_(UnrelEv) secure so that it would n't fall_(RelNScrEv) on anyone , and then I sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down in my assigned_(RelNScrEv) seat and put_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seatbelt on .
 I pulled_(UnrelEv) out a book I brought_(UnrelEv) with me , and read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) until the plane was_(UnrelEv) ready to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 I listened_(ScrEv_listen_crew) to the flight attendant 's safety instructions , and then the plane started_(UnrelEv) to move_(RelNScrEv) - with a mighty jerk , the wheels left_(ScrEv_take_off) the ground and we were_(UnrelEv) flying_(RelNScrEv) .
 It was_(RelNScrEv) very loud with the noise of the engine .
 A few minutes after we took_(ScrEv_take_off) off , the pilot came_(ScrEv_listen_crew) on the intercom and gave_(ScrEv_leave_airport) us some details about the weather and our flight time .
 Then , the flight attendants walked_(ScrEv_other) past in the aisles with their cart , and offered_(ScrEv_other) me a drink .
 I got_(ScrEv_other) a cup of coffee , and drank_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) it while I read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my book .
 A few hours later , the pilot came_(ScrEv_listen_crew) on the intercom and let_(UnrelEv) us know_(UnrelEv) we were getting_(RelNScrEv) ready to land_(ScrEv_landing) .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) my book away , turned_(ScrEv_other) off my phone like the flight attendants asked_(UnrelEv) , and made_(ScrEv_other) sure everything was secure .
 The plane landed_(ScrEv_landing) with a bump .
 After a few minutes of waiting_(ScrEv_other) on the ground , a gate opened_(ScrEv_other) up , and we were allowed_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_other) up and stretch_(RelNScrEv) , and get_(ScrEv_other) our bags out of the compartments .
 A few minutes later , I walked_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off the plane with my bags , and walked_(ScrEv_exit_plane) out to the waiting area to meet_(ScrEv_meet_people) my friend .
 Flying_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) an interesting experience .

 As the day arrived_(UnrelEv) , I packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) everything I needed_(UnrelEv) into a carry on bag and headed_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport .
 Once there I got my ticket printed_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) and checked_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) .
 I had to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security and then wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for about 45 minutes at the terminal .
 Once they announced_(ScrEv_listen_call) boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) , I got_(RelNScrEv) in line and walked_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto the plane .
 I then stowed_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my carry on bag above me and put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my backpack under the seat in front of me .
 I got_(ScrEv_take_seat) situated_(ScrEv_take_seat) with a book and put_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seatbelt on .

 I got_(RelNScrEv) a water from the flight attendant and a small bag of peanuts .
 Once the plane landed_(ScrEv_landing) , everyone got_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for a while as the people in front slowly filed_(ScrEv_exit_plane) out_(ScrEv_exit_plane) .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) finally my turn I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) my carry on bag from above and exited_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane .

 I made_(UnrelEv) sure that the doors to the airplane were_(UnrelEv) all closed_(ScrEv_other) and all the passengers were seated_(ScrEv_take_seat) and buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) in .

 I pulled_(ScrEv_other) the lever to lift_(ScrEv_other) the wheels into the plane .
 I manuveured_(ScrEv_other) the plane 's direction with the pilot wheel to aim_(RelNScrEv) it at the direction I wanted to go_(RelNScrEv) .

 My first flight_(Evoking) out_(Evoking) of_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) United_(Evoking) States_(Evoking) was_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) Myanmar_(Evoking) .
 I was_(UnrelEv) excited_(UnrelEv) but very nervous all at the same time .
 Going_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through security checks and all that comes_(UnrelEv) with it is nerve racking_(UnrelEv) .
 But once I finished_(UnrelEv) with that part , the next thing was understand_(RelNScrEv) the time change and how that affects_(RelNScrEv) my flights and connections was_(UnrelEv) a real hassle .
 Once we got_(ScrEv_board_plane) on the plane it was_(UnrelEv) absolutely wonderful .
 The flight attendants took_(RelNScrEv) great care of us never stopping_(UnrelEv) to rest_(UnrelEv) for the entire 20 hours flight .
 They brought_(ScrEv_other) food , warm face towels , drinks and snacks and all this was included_(RelNScrEv) in the price of the ticket .
 I am_(UnrelEv) very afraid of flying_(RelNScrEv) the take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) the landing_(ScrEv_landing) are the worst parts for me .
 True to my phobia I was_(UnrelEv) in near tears and gripping_(UnrelEv) the seats but once the flight was_(UnrelEv) off the ground I was_(UnrelEv) happy .
 The flight came_(UnrelEv) with a TV in the back of the set in front of you and there was_(UnrelEv) so many choices of what to watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 I love_(UnrelEv) documentaries and there were_(UnrelEv) numerous ones .
 I almost hated_(UnrelEv) when the flight was_(UnrelEv) over .
 The only part that I found_(UnrelEv) difficult was that , I did not have_(UnrelEv) an end seat and so I hesitated_(UnrelEv) to use_(RelNScrEv) the bathroom and did n't do_(UnrelEv) so until I was_(UnrelEv) in extreme discomfort because I did n't want to bother_(UnrelEv) the person on the end seat .
 So , next time I decide_(UnrelEv) to travel_(RelNScrEv) the only change I would make_(UnrelEv) is to select_(RelNScrEv) an end seat that way bathroom use_(UnrelEv) is not an issue .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) not to check_(ScrEv_check_luggage) any bags , so I simply got_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my ticket and then went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through the security line .
 After security I went_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to my terminal to wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for the plane to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 Once we went_(UnrelEv) through the boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) procedure I sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) at my seat next to the window .
 Beside me was_(UnrelEv) an older lady who made_(UnrelEv) small talk with me until the plane took_(ScrEv_take_off) off -LRB- even talking_(UnrelEv) through the safety speech given_(ScrEv_listen_crew) by the flight attendants before we took_(ScrEv_take_off) off -RRB- .
 She quickly fell_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) asleep once we were_(RelNScrEv) in the air though .
 I observed_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the land below and the clouds for awhile before I too fell_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) asleep .
 I awoke_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) to the sound of the flight attendant informing_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us the plane would soon be landing_(ScrEv_landing) .
 I almost barfed_(RelNScrEv) as we made our decent , but managed_(UnrelEv) to hold_(RelNScrEv) it in .
 Once we landed_(ScrEv_landing) I departed_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane with the other passengers .

 Today I am taking_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) to go visit_(UnrelEv) my grandmother .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the ticket a few weeks ago and last night I packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) my suitcases with clothes and the other items I would need_(UnrelEv) for my trip .
 I woke_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) early today and got_(RelNScrEv) my ID and my suitcase and headed_(ScrEv_get_airport) for the airport .
 After I parked_(UnrelEv) my car , I went_(ScrEv_go_check_in) to the check in counter and showed_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) the worker my ID .
 She printed_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) a ticket for me , checked_(ScrEv_check_luggage) in_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my suitcase and told_(RelNScrEv) me what gate to head_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to in order to catch_(UnrelEv) my flight .
 As I got_(ScrEv_find_terminal) close to the gate I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security where they scanned_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my purse and carry-on bag then had me remove_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my shoes and walk_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through the metal detectors .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) my shoes back on and got_(RelNScrEv) my bags and then sat_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) and waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for my flight to start boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 When they made_(ScrEv_listen_call) an announcement that my plane was boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) , I got_(RelNScrEv) in line and waited_(ScrEv_wait) my turn .
 Once I got_(ScrEv_board_plane) on the plane I looked_(RelNScrEv) at_(RelNScrEv) my ticket to find_(RelNScrEv) my seat number , found_(RelNScrEv) my seat and sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down_(ScrEv_take_seat) and buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seat belt .
 After everyone was done boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) , the pilot announced_(ScrEv_listen_crew) we were_(UnrelEv) clear for take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) and the plane began_(UnrelEv) to move_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) .

 I was_(UnrelEv) excited_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) home for the holidays last December , but I was less excited_(UnrelEv) about having_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) take_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) !
 I normally would drive_(UnrelEv) , but my mother persuaded_(UnrelEv) me to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) because she was_(UnrelEv) afraid I would have to drive_(UnrelEv) through snow .
 I filled_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) a single suitcase with as many necessities I could fit_(UnrelEv) , because I did not want_(UnrelEv) to have to deal_(UnrelEv) with putting_(RelNScrEv) multiple suitcases through the luggage handler .
 I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport and waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line to check_(ScrEv_check_in) in .
 I let_(UnrelEv) the TSA search_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) me for any contraband that would not be allowed_(UnrelEv) on the plane , and then waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) to be allowed_(UnrelEv) to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 Once we were let_(ScrEv_board_plane) on the plane , I walked_(ScrEv_take_seat) over to my seat and shoved_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my suitcase into the overhead compartment .
 Luckily it fit_(RelNScrEv) , so I would be_(UnrelEv) able to keep_(RelNScrEv) it with me .
 I snuggled_(RelNScrEv) into my seat and tried_(UnrelEv) to ignore_(UnrelEv) the butterflies in my stomach .
 Flying_(RelNScrEv) always makes_(RelNScrEv) me nervous .
 The person seated_(RelNScrEv) directly next to me was a middle aged woman flying_(RelNScrEv) alone .
 She gave_(UnrelEv) me a sympathetic smile and asked_(UnrelEv) me if I was_(UnrelEv) as nervous as she was_(UnrelEv) .
 I said_(UnrelEv) yes , and I think_(UnrelEv) we both felt_(UnrelEv) better that at least we would be_(UnrelEv) good seatmates .
 The plane ride was_(UnrelEv) uneventful ; after five hours in the air , we landed_(ScrEv_landing) at our destination in one piece .

 The other day I went_(Evoking) for_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) ride_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport with my significant other and we took_(RelNScrEv) our bags .
 We stood_(ScrEv_wait) in line to check_(ScrEv_check_in) our bags and receive_(ScrEv_get_ticket) our tickets .
 We also had to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through a security checkpoint .
 Once on the plane you wait_(RelNScrEv) a little while for everyone to be seated_(ScrEv_take_seat) and then the pilot announces_(ScrEv_listen_crew) that the plain will be taking_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 When the plane is going_(RelNScrEv) up into the air it can feel kind of funny but once the plane reaches_(RelNScrEv) a certain height it is_(UnrelEv) usually smooth sailing_(RelNScrEv) .
 There can sometimes be_(RelNScrEv) some turbulence but there is_(UnrelEv) usually just a smooth ride .
 Sometimes a flight attendant asks_(RelNScrEv) you if you want_(UnrelEv) anything like something to drink_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) or eat_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 There is_(UnrelEv) a bathroom on the plane if you have to go_(UnrelEv) and you can even shave_(UnrelEv) in there .
 Once you get_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off the plane you grab_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) your bags and off you can go_(ScrEv_leave_airport) safely .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) Europe_(Evoking) .
 First , I went_(RelNScrEv) online and found_(ScrEv_get_ticket) tickets to the destination , Bulgaria .
 Then , I purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) those online tickets with my credit card and printed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) out_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the receipt with my printer .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) into my bedroom and packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) all of my bags .
 Then I called_(RelNScrEv) a taxi .
 Once the taxi arrived_(RelNScrEv) , I put_(RelNScrEv) my bags into the trunk of the taxi and the taxi driver drove_(ScrEv_get_airport) me to the airport .
 At the airport , I waited_(ScrEv_wait) in the line for Delta flights to check_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) my bags .
 Once my bags were checked_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) , I got_(ScrEv_other) my boarding pass .
 Next , I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the second floor of the airport terminal , where my carry on luggage was scanned_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) and I was searched_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) .
 Then , I went_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my gate and saw_(UnrelEv) the airplane waiting_(RelNScrEv) outside on the loading arm .
 After 20 minutes , the stewardess made_(ScrEv_listen_call) an announcement that the airplane was boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 I got_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) the flight , took_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat and the airplane took_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 Then I flew_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) for 5 hours .

 I walked_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane and was greeted_(ScrEv_listen_crew) by the stewardess who had_(UnrelEv) a very kind smile .
 I walked_(ScrEv_board_plane) slowly behind the other passengers as people were shoving_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) their luggage into the overhead compartments .
 I found_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat just ahead of the right wing .
 I buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) into_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seat next to the window , and prepared_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) myself for takeoff_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 The stewardess explained_(ScrEv_listen_crew) all the pre-flight information about safety .
 The plane started_(UnrelEv) to taxi_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to the runway .
 My stomach started_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) a little twisted .
 The engines started_(UnrelEv) to roar_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) and the passengers were pushed_(RelNScrEv) back_(RelNScrEv) into their seats .
 In a few seconds the plane started_(UnrelEv) climbing_(ScrEv_take_off) and we were_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 I watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the the trees and the buildings get_(UnrelEv) smaller and smaller .
 After a few minutes we started_(UnrelEv) to level_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) and everything on the ground looked_(UnrelEv) miniature .
 We were_(Unclear) above the clouds for most of the flight , but I still love_(UnrelEv) looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the window .
 As we began_(ScrEv_landing) our descent , we went_(RelNScrEv) through_(RelNScrEv) rain clouds and it was_(UnrelEv) a bit bumpy , but we landed_(ScrEv_landing) safely and exited_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane the same way we began_(ScrEv_board_plane) , slow and without efficiency .

 I flew_(Evoking) to Iceland one year on vacation .
 I left_(RelNScrEv) JFK airport in New York and flew_(Evoking) to Keflavik in Iceland .
 JFK is_(UnrelEv) an enormous airport .
 I parked_(ScrEv_get_airport) in long term parking and then took_(ScrEv_other) a shuttle to actual terminals .
 I felt_(UnrelEv) so nervous that I would n't make_(RelNScrEv) my flight !
 I was_(UnrelEv) so afraid beforehand of getting_(UnrelEv) my bag lost_(RelNScrEv) that I just packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) everything I needed_(UnrelEv) into a small carry on bag .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_in) in and then went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to security .
 Security moved_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) along quickly and I was waiting_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) at my gate to catch_(RelNScrEv) my flight .
 JFK airport is_(UnrelEv) pretty gross !
 While I was waiting_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) , I had_(UnrelEv) a beer at a restaurant .
 A roach fell_(UnrelEv) on my husband who was_(UnrelEv) with me !
 We quietly called_(UnrelEv) our server over and she stepped_(UnrelEv) on it and told_(UnrelEv) us it happens_(UnrelEv) all the time !
 We were_(UnrelEv) so disgusted .
 It actually made_(UnrelEv) us want to get_(ScrEv_board_plane) on the plane even quicker and get_(UnrelEv) out of there .
 Finally , we boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane and were seated_(ScrEv_take_seat) next to some nice people from Oregon .
 We chatted_(UnrelEv) a bit with them and I watched_(UnrelEv) an in-flight movie of Jane Eyre .
 Finally we got_(UnrelEv) to Iceland .
 I loved_(UnrelEv) flying_(RelNScrEv) !

 We went_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport , and gave_(ScrEv_check_in) our bags to an attendant to be checked_(ScrEv_check_luggage) onto the plane .

 It was_(UnrelEv) a little scary , but kind of fun , too .

 I 've only ever flown_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) once .
 I 'm_(UnrelEv) terribly afraid of flying_(Evoking) , but I had enlisted_(UnrelEv) in the US Navy and I had to fly_(Evoking) out_(Evoking) from Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania to Chicago Illinois to go_(UnrelEv) to boot camp at Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes , Illinois .
 I remember_(UnrelEv) getting_(ScrEv_get_airport) to_(ScrEv_get_airport) the airport and not being_(UnrelEv) sure of where everything was_(UnrelEv) , because I had never even been_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) an airport before .
 I was_(UnrelEv) really nervous about the flight , too , so everything just seemed_(UnrelEv) to be happening_(UnrelEv) all at once .
 After boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane , which was_(UnrelEv) much smaller than I had expected_(UnrelEv) , I sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) nervously waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for_(ScrEv_wait) the plane to start_(ScrEv_take_off) and fully expecting_(UnrelEv) to die_(UnrelEv) at any moment .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to sit_(ScrEv_take_seat) towards the middle of the plane , so that I would n't be_(UnrelEv) the first to die_(UnrelEv) if the plane crashed_(RelNScrEv) , which placed_(ScrEv_take_seat) me right next to the wing .
 I also decided_(UnrelEv) to sit_(ScrEv_take_seat) next to the window so that I 'd know_(UnrelEv) right away if anything went_(RelNScrEv) wrong_(RelNScrEv) and I 'd have_(UnrelEv) time to panic_(RelNScrEv) before I hit_(RelNScrEv) the ground .
 After waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for what seemed_(UnrelEv) like an eternity for the plane to start_(ScrEv_take_off) , we eventually got_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) the ground and I went_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) into_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) full panic mode and stared_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the window for the rest of the flight .
 As we were starting_(ScrEv_take_off) out_(ScrEv_take_off) over Pittsburgh , I noticed_(UnrelEv) that the ground really did n't look_(UnrelEv) like what I expected_(UnrelEv) .
 It seemed_(UnrelEv) like there was_(UnrelEv) water everywhere , like little lakes and ponds , whereas I expected_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) streams and creeks because we have_(UnrelEv) them everywhere in this area .
 We just seemed_(UnrelEv) to keep_(UnrelEv) going_(ScrEv_take_off) up_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 We flew_(ScrEv_take_off) up_(ScrEv_take_off) past the clouds and I could n't see_(UnrelEv) the ground anymore .
 The sun seemed_(UnrelEv) much lower in the sky than I thought_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) .
 It kind of felt_(UnrelEv) like I could reach_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) and grab_(UnrelEv) it if I wanted_(UnrelEv) to .
 The sky got_(UnrelEv) noticeably thinner and I could start_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) stars and stuff .
 The flight itself was_(UnrelEv) very calm .
 I did n't experience_(RelNScrEv) any of the turbulence that I 'd expected_(UnrelEv) and I started_(UnrelEv) to feel_(RelNScrEv) a little bit better about flying_(Evoking) .
 That was_(UnrelEv) until we started_(ScrEv_landing) back down .
 I was terrified_(UnrelEv) when we went_(UnrelEv) in_(UnrelEv) to land_(ScrEv_landing) .
 The plane tilted_(ScrEv_landing) forward_(ScrEv_landing) and it felt_(UnrelEv) like we were going_(ScrEv_landing) straight into the ground , and I started_(UnrelEv) panicking_(RelNScrEv) again .
 Of course , though , everything was_(UnrelEv) fine .
 We touched_(ScrEv_landing) down_(ScrEv_landing) gently and it was_(UnrelEv) over before I knew_(UnrelEv) it .
 But I promised_(UnrelEv) myself I would never fly_(Evoking) again .
 I only flew_(Evoking) in that instance because I had_(UnrelEv) to .

 Last week , I flew_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) to visit_(UnrelEv) a different state .
 After I parked_(RelNScrEv) my car in the parking lot , I found_(ScrEv_go_check_in) the right ticket counter for my airline and then turned_(ScrEv_check_in) in my suitcase so it could travel_(RelNScrEv) in the cargo of the plane .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to a place called_(UnrelEv) a gate which is_(UnrelEv) really just an indoor place to wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for my plane to arrive_(ScrEv_other) .
 It has_(UnrelEv) a big window where I watched_(UnrelEv) the planes and waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for my turn to get_(ScrEv_board_plane) on one .
 Once my plane arrived_(ScrEv_other) , a nice flight attendant showed_(RelNScrEv) me to my seat and I sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down to wait_(ScrEv_wait) .
 My seat was_(UnrelEv) comfortable , but small , and there were_(UnrelEv) people sitting_(UnrelEv) on each side of me .
 Once everyone settled_(RelNScrEv) in , the plane started_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) and then drove_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) down the runway to wait_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) its turn to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 When we took_(ScrEv_take_off) off , it rose_(ScrEv_take_off) into the air and then leveled_(RelNScrEv) off to what the pilot called_(UnrelEv) cruising speed .
 Then the flight attendants brought_(ScrEv_other) around food and drinks .
 The plane was_(UnrelEv) a little noisy , but it was_(UnrelEv) fun to watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the people and the food was_(UnrelEv) pretty good .
 The plane ride was_(UnrelEv) short and we had_(UnrelEv) barely finished_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) our food and drinks before the pilot said_(ScrEv_listen_crew) it was_(UnrelEv) time to land_(RelNScrEv) in the next town .
 The flight attendants came_(UnrelEv) back around to pick_(RelNScrEv) up our trash and then we had to buckle_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seat belts again for the plane to land_(ScrEv_landing) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a fun trip and I hope_(UnrelEv) I get_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) it again sometime .

 Last Friday , I took_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) flight_(Evoking) to New York for a business trip .
 About two weeks before the trip , I went_(RelNScrEv) online_(RelNScrEv) and determined_(UnrelEv) which airlines flew_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) New_(Evoking) York_(Evoking) , and how much it cost_(RelNScrEv) for each flight .
 After looking_(RelNScrEv) at_(RelNScrEv) all the possible flights , I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) morning_(Evoking) jetBlue_(Evoking) flight_(Evoking) , which was_(UnrelEv) also the cheapest .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the ticket online with my credit card , and printed_(ScrEv_get_ticket) out_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a boarding pass on my printer .
 On Friday morning , I got_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) before sunrise and showered_(UnrelEv) , then packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) the items I would need_(UnrelEv) for the trip into my small travel bag .
 I had_(UnrelEv) just a few minutes to make_(UnrelEv) a cup of coffee , then drove_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport .
 I parked_(RelNScrEv) in the parking garage , then made_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my way to the terminal .
 First , I checked_(RelNScrEv) the flight information board to see_(UnrelEv) if my flight was_(RelNScrEv) on-time , which it was_(UnrelEv) , and to find_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the departure gate .
 Then I proceeded_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to security , waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line , and then after clearing_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security , went_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to_(ScrEv_find_terminal) the boarding gate .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for only ten minutes , and they called_(ScrEv_listen_call) for_(ScrEv_listen_call) general boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) , so into the line I went_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) , and the gate agent scanned_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) my boarding pass as I entered_(ScrEv_board_plane) the jetway .
 I was greeted_(RelNScrEv) by an attendant as I entered_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane , and I slowly made_(RelNScrEv) my way down the aisle to my seat , 16A .
 After stowing_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my bag in the overhead bin , I sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) in my seat and buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) up_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) .
 Soon after that , the door closed_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) , we pushed_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) back_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) from the gate and the engines spooled_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) up_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) .
 We were_(ScrEv_take_off) in the air within 5 minutes , climbing_(ScrEv_take_off) to 35,000 feet through the clouds .
 I was able_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) get_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a cup of coffee during the short flight , and within 30 minutes , we were already beginning_(ScrEv_landing) out descent .
 The attendant collected_(RelNScrEv) the empty coffee cup , and soon after we were touching_(ScrEv_landing) down_(ScrEv_landing) .
 It was_(Unclear) a quick ride to the gate , seat belts off , and everybody got_(ScrEv_exit_plane) up_(ScrEv_exit_plane) , grabbing_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) their luggage .

 Then I started_(UnrelEv) packing_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) my bags to make_(UnrelEv) sure I had_(UnrelEv) everything that I needed_(UnrelEv) for my trip .
 I also planned_(UnrelEv) to figure_(RelNScrEv) out how I was going to arrive_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport .
 On the day of the flight , once I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport , I checked_(ScrEv_check_luggage) one of my bags and proceeded_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to the TSA terminal .
 At the TSA the check_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) your ID and make_(UnrelEv) sure you do n't bring_(RelNScrEv) anything that is not allowed_(RelNScrEv) on the plane .
 I was not bringing_(RelNScrEv) anything that was not allowed_(RelNScrEv) so I got_(RelNScrEv) in with no problems .
 After that I found_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my gate , waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) a bit and boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 On the plane I looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out of the window and took_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) some naps .

 Last year I visited_(UnrelEv) my friend across the country .
 I live_(UnrelEv) in California and he lives_(UnrelEv) in North Carolina .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that I was n't going to drive_(UnrelEv) all that way ; I needed_(UnrelEv) a more efficient option .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to start_(UnrelEv) looking_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) how much a flight would cost_(RelNScrEv) .
 I researched_(RelNScrEv) what airlines provided_(RelNScrEv) flights from the airport nearest to where I live_(UnrelEv) .
 I then had to decide_(UnrelEv) when exactly I wanted_(UnrelEv) to fly_(Evoking) there_(Evoking) and back , as some days can be_(UnrelEv) cheaper than others .
 We settled_(RelNScrEv) on the dates that worked_(UnrelEv) best for both of us , and I booked_(ScrEv_get_ticket) the cheapest flight I could find_(RelNScrEv) for a round-trip ticket .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) time for my trip , I packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) my bags and coordinated_(RelNScrEv) with a friend to give_(ScrEv_get_airport) me a ride to the airport .
 My friend picked_(ScrEv_get_airport) me up early enough so that by the time we got_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport , I would be_(RelNScrEv) about an hour and a half early for my flight .
 I then had to check_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) and go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security .
 Because I only had_(UnrelEv) one small suitcase , I did not have to check_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my bags .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) in the terminal for my flight to arrive_(ScrEv_landing) , reading_(RelNScrEv) a book to pass_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) the time .
 When the plane landed_(ScrEv_landing) from the previous flight , I also had to wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for those passengers to unload_(ScrEv_exit_plane) .
 They began calling_(ScrEv_listen_call) different sections to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) , and mine was_(UnrelEv) one of the last ones .
 I easily found_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat and stowed_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my suitcase in the compartment above .
 I was sitting_(ScrEv_take_seat) in the middle row , and the other two passengers next to me were_(ScrEv_take_seat) already in their seats .
 When I got_(UnrelEv) seated_(ScrEv_take_seat) , I went_(UnrelEv) ahead and buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) my seat belt and awaited_(Unclear) take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 The flight attendants had to make_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) all their checks and when it was_(UnrelEv) time to go_(ScrEv_take_off) , we also had_(ScrEv_listen_crew) an overview of the emergency procedures .
 I did n't have_(UnrelEv) too much room between myself and the seat in front of me , but there was_(UnrelEv) a little tray on the back of that seat which I put_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) to use_(UnrelEv) to hold_(UnrelEv) the drink I ordered_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) later .
 I made_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) small talk with the passengers next to me and we shared_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) our travel plans .
 It was_(UnrelEv) overall a decent flight , and we made_(RelNScrEv) good time and arrived_(ScrEv_landing) with no issues .

 A month ago , I bought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a plane ticket online .
 I chose_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a round-trip ticket and was able to pick_(RelNScrEv) a window seat .
 The day of my flight , I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport 2 hours early to be able to check_(ScrEv_check_in) in and go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through security with plenty of time to spare_(UnrelEv) to make_(RelNScrEv) my flight on time .
 I boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 I placed_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) my baggage in the overhead bin and took_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat near the window .
 Two people sat_(RelNScrEv) next to me , filling_(UnrelEv) out the row .
 I put_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) on my seat belt .
 The stewardess informed_(ScrEv_listen_crew) everyone about safety precautions .
 Everyone put_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) their seats in the upright position and locked_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) up their tray tables .
 The pilot spoke_(ScrEv_listen_crew) to us over the intercom , telling_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us to sit_(UnrelEv) back and relax_(UnrelEv) , and that we will reach_(RelNScrEv) our destination in a short time .
 The plane rumbled_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) to life , sped_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) forward , and off we soared_(ScrEv_take_off) into the sky .
 My ears popped_(RelNScrEv) from the change in air pressure but it only took_(UnrelEv) a few moments for my body to acclimate_(RelNScrEv) itself to its new , airborne environment .
 The stewardess served_(ScrEv_other) the passengers drinks and peanuts .
 I took_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a nap .
 Once I awoke_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) , we were landing_(ScrEv_landing) .
 We were told_(UnrelEv) to put_(RelNScrEv) our seats back in the upright position and to lock_(RelNScrEv) back up our tray tables .
 We glided_(ScrEv_landing) to the ground and landed_(ScrEv_landing) with a bit of a bump and jolt .
 The plane pulled_(ScrEv_other) up to the gate and we were let_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off .

 I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I had_(UnrelEv) my ticket in advance and checked_(RelNScrEv) to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) my flight was not canceled_(RelNScrEv) .
 I had pre-packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) what I needed_(UnrelEv) and doubled checked_(RelNScrEv) the list to make sure that all my items were approved_(UnrelEv) .
 Then , I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport about one and a half hours early .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) security first , since there were_(UnrelEv) long lines for that .
 I had to take_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) off_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my shoes and put_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my bags through an x-ray .
 After I was done_(UnrelEv) , I put_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my luggage in the correct area so it could be loaded_(RelNScrEv) on the plane .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) until my plane was ready to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) and showed_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) the flight attendant my boarding pass .
 I stayed_(UnrelEv) quietly on the plane and made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I was_(UnrelEv) in my assigned_(RelNScrEv) seat .
 It can be_(UnrelEv) crowded and boring , so I read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my book on the flight .
 I made sure to listen_(ScrEv_listen_crew) to the flight attendants when they had_(UnrelEv) an announcement to make_(UnrelEv) .

 Yesterday , I woke_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) at 5 AM because I knew_(UnrelEv) that I had_(UnrelEv) a flight to catch_(Evoking) .
 I ate_(UnrelEv) my breakfast and waited_(UnrelEv) for_(UnrelEv) my friend Wayne to pick_(UnrelEv) me up because he was going to drop_(ScrEv_get_airport) me off at the airport so I could board_(ScrEv_board_plane) my plane .
 Once I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) at the airport I showed_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) them my ticket for my flight to Los Angeles , California and they told_(UnrelEv) me I would have to wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) a few minutes .
 I sat_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) and waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) and read_(UnrelEv) a few magazines before they announced_(ScrEv_listen_call) that my plane was boarding_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 I was checked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to see_(UnrelEv) if anything was_(Unclear) on me in the security area before entering_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 Once I got_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane I went_(UnrelEv) to the window seat and sat_(ScrEv_take_seat) down_(ScrEv_take_seat) .
 I put_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) on_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my headphones and listened_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) to_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) music for about an hour .
 I then was asked_(UnrelEv) if I wanted_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) food from the flight attendant .
 I got_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) myself a sandwich for lunch before we arrived_(ScrEv_landing) shortly in Los Angeles .
 I got_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane and noted_(UnrelEv) that I had_(UnrelEv) a very pleasant flight .

 My family and I began_(UnrelEv) by going_(UnrelEv) through_(UnrelEv) the gruesome experience of the airport .
 2 hours later we were_(ScrEv_board_plane) finally on the plane and ready to take_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 We put_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) on_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seat belts and got mentally prepared_(RelNScrEv) for the flight ahead .
 Fortunately we were going_(RelNScrEv) to Disney World and were_(UnrelEv) all ecstatic for the experience that was to come_(UnrelEv) .
 The problem is_(UnrelEv) that my brother has_(UnrelEv) a major fear of heights and airplanes , and I had to sit_(ScrEv_take_seat) by him .
 I told_(UnrelEv) him not to watch_(UnrelEv) the movies about airplanes crashing_(RelNScrEv) , but he never listens_(UnrelEv) and frightens_(UnrelEv) himself more with each scene .
 The pilot and flight attendants do_(UnrelEv) a great job at catering_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) to everyone 's needs .
 The pilot keeps_(RelNScrEv) the plane steady with very little turbulence making_(RelNScrEv) a easy and safe ride for all .
 We arrive_(ScrEv_landing) at our destination and after a bumpy landing_(ScrEv_landing) we have arrived_(ScrEv_landing) in Florida and are_(UnrelEv) ready to go_(ScrEv_go_target_location) to Disney World !

 I wanted to go_(UnrelEv) to Atlanta to visit_(UnrelEv) my daughter , son-in-law and granddaughter .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) on-line and searched_(ScrEv_other) for the cheapest flights for the weekend on which I wanted to go_(UnrelEv) .
 I saw_(UnrelEv) that Frontier Airlines had_(UnrelEv) a really reasonable rate so I purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a ticket for Friday , March 13th through Sunday , March 15th .
 Several hours before my flight was_(RelNScrEv) due , I drove_(ScrEv_get_airport) to National Airport and parked_(RelNScrEv) in the daily-rate lot .
 I went_(ScrEv_other) into the airport and passed_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through the security checkpoint , showing_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) the TSA agent my electronic ticket\/boarding pass and my driver 's license .
 Once through security I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) at the gate until the plane had landed_(RelNScrEv) for my flight .

 Last week I flew_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) to visit_(UnrelEv) my aunt .
 First I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) everything I would need_(UnrelEv) in my suitcase and had_(UnrelEv) a friend drive_(ScrEv_get_airport) me to the airport .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) at the airline desk and gave_(ScrEv_check_luggage) them my suitcase to load_(RelNScrEv) onto the plane .
 Next it was_(UnrelEv) time to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the security checkpoint and head_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to the terminal so I could get_(ScrEv_board_plane) onto_(ScrEv_board_plane) the airplane .
 There were_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) no problems with security , so I headed_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to the terminal to wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) my flight to start_(UnrelEv) letting_(UnrelEv) people get_(ScrEv_board_plane) on_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 On the way I bought_(RelNScrEv) a magazine so I would have_(UnrelEv) something to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 Once I found_(RelNScrEv) a seat in the terminal , I sat_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) back_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) and started_(UnrelEv) to look_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) through_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my magazine .
 After about 20 minutes the plane started_(UnrelEv) loading_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) .
 I got_(ScrEv_wait) in line , showed_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) my ticket and headed_(ScrEv_board_plane) down_(ScrEv_board_plane) the walkway into the plane .
 When I found_(ScrEv_take_seat) my seat , I was_(UnrelEv) happy to see_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) by a window so I could look_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) as we went_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 It took_(UnrelEv) about 15 minutes to get_(UnrelEv) everyone settled_(ScrEv_take_seat) in_(ScrEv_take_seat) , then it was_(UnrelEv) time to go_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 The flight attendant told_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us where the exits were_(UnrelEv) , then we buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seatbelts and the plane started_(UnrelEv) moving_(ScrEv_take_off) .
 The captain announced_(ScrEv_listen_crew) that the weather was_(UnrelEv) good and we should have_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) great_(Evoking) flight_(Evoking) .
 Then he brought_(ScrEv_take_off_preparations) the engines up to full and we headed_(ScrEv_take_off) down_(ScrEv_take_off) the runway and lifted_(ScrEv_take_off) off_(ScrEv_take_off) into the sky .
 Once we could take_(ScrEv_other) our seatbelts off , I got_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a soda from the flight attendant and got_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) my magazine out .
 Between reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) and looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) the window at the clouds below us the flight went_(Unclear) quickly .
 I did n't even finish_(UnrelEv) reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) before it was_(UnrelEv) time to put_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seatbelts back on and land_(ScrEv_landing) .
 We all got_(ScrEv_exit_plane) off_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane and headed_(ScrEv_get_destination_airport) to the baggage claim area to get_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) our suitcases .
 Mine came_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) out_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) pretty early , so I grabbed_(ScrEv_retrieve_luggage) it and headed_(ScrEv_go_target_location) out_(ScrEv_go_target_location) of the airport .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a great flight and I had_(UnrelEv) a good time visiting_(UnrelEv) my aunt .

 Two weeks ago I went_(RelNScrEv) on a vacation to Florida .
 Getting_(RelNScrEv) there meant having to fly_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) !
 I arranged_(UnrelEv) for a friend to drive_(ScrEv_get_airport) me to the airport , and drop_(ScrEv_get_airport) me off at the door near check in .
 I pulled_(UnrelEv) a suitcase on wheels behind me and swung_(UnrelEv) my small carry on bag over my shoulder .
 Once inside I followed_(RelNScrEv) signs and made_(ScrEv_go_check_in) my way to my airlines luggage drop off area .
 A man weight_(RelNScrEv) my suitcase , put_(RelNScrEv) a sticker on it , and whisked_(RelNScrEv) it out of my sight .
 Then I printed_(RelNScrEv) a boarding pass and made_(RelNScrEv) my way to the security line .
 There I waited_(ScrEv_wait) until my turn , showed_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) the security agent my ID card and went_(UnrelEv) to the walk_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) metal detector .
 Finally , I could make_(ScrEv_find_terminal) my way to my gate where I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) to be called_(ScrEv_listen_call) to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 Once on board the plane I found_(RelNScrEv) my seat number and settled_(ScrEv_take_seat) in_(ScrEv_take_seat) comfortably .
 Before I knew_(UnrelEv) it we were_(UnrelEv) in the air .
 A flight attendant gave_(RelNScrEv) me a soda , and I relaxed_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) watching_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a movie until we finally landed_(ScrEv_landing) in Florida three hours later .

 As I walked_(ScrEv_get_airport) in through the sliding glass door I could feel_(UnrelEv) my excitement rising_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) in my body .
 You see I had just entered_(ScrEv_get_airport) the airport and this was_(UnrelEv) my first time ever flying_(Evoking) !
 I went_(ScrEv_go_check_in) over to the self check in with my mom and typed_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) my ticket number and checked_(ScrEv_check_luggage) my bag .
 After receiving_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my tickets I went_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) to the dreaded_(UnrelEv) security check point .
 To my surprise it was_(UnrelEv) not as bad as I had thought_(UnrelEv) .
 Even though the line was_(UnrelEv) long it seemed_(UnrelEv) to move_(RelNScrEv) quickly .
 I showed_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) my ticket and ID to the agent and then kind of followed_(UnrelEv) what everyone else was doing_(UnrelEv) .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) a bin and took_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) off_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my shoes and put_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my book bag on the rolling belt as well .
 I emptied_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) all my pockets and walked_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) the metal detector .
 To my surprise it did not beep_(RelNScrEv) , but my mom was_(UnrelEv) not so lucky .
 She had to get waved_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) by that wand thing and they discovered_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) her belt buckle setting_(RelNScrEv) it off .
 After we grabbed_(RelNScrEv) our things and I got_(UnrelEv) a book to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) on the flight from a newsstand in the airport .
 We found_(ScrEv_find_terminal) our gate and they called_(ScrEv_listen_call) us in groups .
 We got_(ScrEv_wait) in line and handed_(ScrEv_present_boarding_pass) the attendant our tickets and boarded_(ScrEv_board_plane) the plane .
 I got_(ScrEv_take_seat) the window seat and was_(UnrelEv) super excited of getting to see_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out the window .
 The woman gave_(ScrEv_listen_crew) us the safety demo and we were_(UnrelEv) off !
 I was_(UnrelEv) a little nervous on take off but after that it was_(UnrelEv) smooth sailing .
 Two Diet Cokes and three hours later we arrived_(ScrEv_landing) in Chicago !

 A few weeks ago , I flew_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) airplane_(Evoking) to visit_(RelNScrEv) my brother in Tampa , Florida , which is_(UnrelEv) a thousand miles from me .
 I had bought_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my ticket six weeks earlier on the internet , and had packed_(RelNScrEv) my bags the night before .
 The weather in Tampa is_(UnrelEv) very warm , so I packed_(ScrEv_pack_luggage) all summer clothes even though it was_(UnrelEv) still winter .
 On the day of my flight , I arrived_(ScrEv_get_airport) early so that I would have_(UnrelEv) time to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through the security line , where they made me take_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) off_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my shoes and my belt , and put_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) my bag through the x-ray machine .
 An airline worker made_(ScrEv_listen_call) an announcement when it was_(UnrelEv) time for us to board_(ScrEv_board_plane) the flight .
 We went_(RelNScrEv) to our assigned_(UnrelEv) seats , put_(ScrEv_stow_away_luggage) our bags in the overhead compartments , and then buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) in .
 During the flight , I watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a movie on my Kindle and got_(RelNScrEv) a Coke zero from the flight attended .
 When the flight landed_(ScrEv_landing) , my brother was waiting_(RelNScrEv) for me outside the airport .

 Several months ago I had to travel_(UnrelEv) to a city in the midwest for a business conference .
 I needed to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) plane_(Evoking) to get_(UnrelEv) there .
 I had to purchase_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a ticket , so I went_(UnrelEv) online to a travel website .
 There were_(UnrelEv) a lot of options to choose_(RelNScrEv) from .
 I first picked_(UnrelEv) the day I wanted to travel_(RelNScrEv) , and what airport I was leaving_(RelNScrEv) from , and where I was going_(UnrelEv) to .
 I then had to choose_(UnrelEv) when I wanted to leave_(UnrelEv) , in the morning or the afternoon .
 I chose_(UnrelEv) everything I needed_(UnrelEv) and purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) my ticket with my credit card .
 The day of my flight , I drove_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport and parked_(RelNScrEv) in the parking garage .
 I took_(ScrEv_go_check_in) my luggage inside to the ticketing counter .
 I told_(UnrelEv) the attendant I where I was flying_(RelNScrEv) to and the flight number , and that I had_(UnrelEv) a bag to check_(RelNScrEv) .
 She took_(ScrEv_present_ID/ticket) my identification card and the flight information , and checked_(ScrEv_check_in) me in for the flight .
 She put_(ScrEv_other) a big tag on my bag , and put_(UnrelEv) it on a moving_(UnrelEv) conveyor belt behind her and it disappeared_(UnrelEv) .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) it would be safe and arrive_(RelNScrEv) when I did_(UnrelEv) , but it did seem_(UnrelEv) kind of mysterious .
 I then took_(ScrEv_other) my ticket and went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to the security checkpoint .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through a large machine , but I was_(UnrelEv) n't nervous .
 I then went_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to my gate to wait_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) for my flight .
 Eventually we were told_(ScrEv_listen_call) that we could board_(ScrEv_board_plane) .
 We all got_(ScrEv_board_plane) on the plane and took_(ScrEv_take_seat) our seats .
 When everyone was_(UnrelEv) on , we fastened_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seatbelts and began_(UnrelEv) to move_(RelNScrEv) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) fun looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out the window .
 All of sudden we were speeding_(RelNScrEv) very fast down the runway , and then lifted_(ScrEv_take_off) into the air .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) surprising such a big plane can fly_(RelNScrEv) so easily .
 I watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) as the world seemed_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) smaller .
 We then leveled_(ScrEv_other) off and flew_(RelNScrEv) straight to our destination .
 I slept_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a bit on the plane , and read_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) a book that I brought_(UnrelEv) .
 They did_(UnrelEv) offer_(ScrEv_other) us some snacks and drinks .
 A short time later , the Captain announced_(ScrEv_listen_crew) we were going to land_(ScrEv_landing) .
 Everyone put_(ScrEv_other) their items away , and we landed_(ScrEv_landing) soon after .
 When we got_(ScrEv_get_destination_airport) to the gate , everyone undid_(ScrEv_other) their seat belts and started_(UnrelEv) to exit_(ScrEv_exit_plane) the plane .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a very good and smooth flight in the airplane .

 Last October I had_(UnrelEv) the chance to fly_(Evoking) from the USA back to England where I come_(UnrelEv) from to visit_(UnrelEv) my mother and my brothers .
 There is_(UnrelEv) an airport quite close to where I live_(UnrelEv) so I purchased_(ScrEv_get_ticket) a ticket online to leave_(UnrelEv) from that airport .
 When I got_(ScrEv_get_airport) to the airport I had to check_(ScrEv_check_in) in first .
 That meant_(UnrelEv) going_(ScrEv_go_check_in) to the line of check in desks so the personnel there could give_(ScrEv_get_ticket) me my boarding tickets -LRB- which allow_(UnrelEv) me onto the plane -RRB- , and take_(RelNScrEv) my suitcases off me to put_(RelNScrEv) on the plane .
 The suitcases were weighed_(ScrEv_check_luggage) first to make_(UnrelEv) sure they were_(UnrelEv) not too heavy and were sent_(RelNScrEv) back behind the check in desks on a long conveyor belt .
 Once they had gone_(UnrelEv) all I could do_(UnrelEv) was hope_(UnrelEv) they ended_(RelNScrEv) up on the same plane as me !
 When I had_(UnrelEv) my boarding pass I was told_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) through security where you are screened_(ScrEv_go_security_checks) to make_(UnrelEv) sure you are not carrying_(RelNScrEv) anything illegal such as weapons or sharp objects .
 In some airports now , like the one near me , they use_(RelNScrEv) a body scanning machine that you walk_(RelNScrEv) into , a bit like a shower cubicle .
 I was called_(RelNScrEv) into this scanner and told_(UnrelEv) to place_(RelNScrEv) my feet on some footprints painted_(UnrelEv) in the cubicle , and then I had to raise_(RelNScrEv) my arms above my head .
 When i was_(UnrelEv) in position the machine turned_(UnrelEv) on and scanned_(RelNScrEv) me quickly and then I was told_(UnrelEv) I could step_(RelNScrEv) out .
 While this was going_(UnrelEv) on , my hand luggage -LRB- the bag I took_(RelNScrEv) on the plane with me -RRB- was placed_(ScrEv_check_luggage) on a conveyor belt and was x-rayed_(ScrEv_check_luggage) by airport security people .
 When they were satisfied_(UnrelEv) everything I had_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) legal and safe I was allowed_(UnrelEv) to proceed_(ScrEv_find_terminal) to the gate , which is_(UnrelEv) where the plane leaves_(ScrEv_take_off) from .
 At the gate I waited_(ScrEv_wait_boarding) to be called_(ScrEv_listen_call) onto the airplane and finally walked_(ScrEv_get_plane) down a long gangway and into the plane .
 My seat was_(UnrelEv) next to the window and I had_(UnrelEv) my own television screen in front of me which was showing_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) movies , or I could turn_(UnrelEv) it to a map which showed_(RelNScrEv) where the plane was flying_(RelNScrEv) over .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a bright red blanket and a white pillow on the seat as it is_(UnrelEv) a very long flight , 11 hours , and people generally go_(UnrelEv) to sleep_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) .
 The steward brought_(RelNScrEv) everyone headphones so we could listen_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) to the television , We had to watch_(RelNScrEv) the stewards give_(ScrEv_other) a safety demonstration so we knew_(UnrelEv) what to do_(RelNScrEv) in an emergency , and then we all buckled_(ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt) our seat belts to get ready for take_(ScrEv_take_off) off .
 Take_(ScrEv_take_off) off was_(UnrelEv) noisy but fast and it was_(UnrelEv) very exciting_(UnrelEv) to look_(ScrEv_spend_time_flight) out of the window and see_(UnrelEv) the ground getting_(UnrelEv) further and further away until all I could see_(UnrelEv) was clouds .

 However , this week was_(UnrelEv) different and I had_(UnrelEv) a party to prepare_(UnrelEv) for_(UnrelEv) the weekend to celebrate_(UnrelEv) a friend 's birthday .
 I created_(ScrEv_make_list) a check list of all the things I needed_(RelNScrEv) earlier in the day , and headed_(ScrEv_go_grocery) out_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store .
 On arrival I went_(ScrEv_move_section) down_(ScrEv_move_section) each lane , and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) on what I needed_(RelNScrEv) exactly .
 This process can be_(UnrelEv) very boring so I kept_(UnrelEv) my MP3 player along with me to play_(UnrelEv) music while I shop_(Evoking) .
 After about 30 minutes of looking_(ScrEv_move_section) around_(ScrEv_move_section) , I finally had_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything that I needed_(RelNScrEv) !
 I go_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the cashier , and ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) picking_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a magazine on the way there .

 When I go_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) it is_(UnrelEv) usually pretty hectic .
 Right now I ca n't drive_(UnrelEv) , so I have to find_(UnrelEv) a ride there .
 I also have to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) that I find_(UnrelEv) someone who has_(UnrelEv) a car that my two children will fit_(UnrelEv) in_(UnrelEv) as well .
 So , after finding_(UnrelEv) a way to get_(ScrEv_go_grocery) there_(ScrEv_go_grocery) , I get_(UnrelEv) a cart wiped_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) and put_(RelNScrEv) my youngest in the seat .
 Of course , if there happens_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) a car cart , we have to take_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) that one so both kids can sit_(RelNScrEv) inside_(RelNScrEv) .
 If I remembered_(UnrelEv) to bring_(ScrEv_make_list) my list , I get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all of the stuff on it first .
 I always grab_(ScrEv_get_groceries) other things as I see_(UnrelEv) them and realize_(UnrelEv) I need_(RelNScrEv) them .
 It can be_(UnrelEv) a good thing , or a bad thing .
 We usually end_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) with quite a bit more than I intended_(ScrEv_make_list) , but since I ca n't go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store whenever I want_(UnrelEv) , I usually justify_(UnrelEv) it to myself .
 So , we get_(ScrEv_wait) into_(ScrEv_wait) the check out line and of course I have to tell_(RelNScrEv) my oldest child we ca n't get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) every candy he sees_(UnrelEv) in the aisle while we are waiting_(ScrEv_wait) .
 After we check_(ScrEv_pay) out_(ScrEv_pay) , we go_(ScrEv_leave) outside_(ScrEv_leave) and I get_(RelNScrEv) the kiddos in first .
 Then to bring_(UnrelEv) our shopping trip to an end , I puzzle_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) piece_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) everything into the back of our car and return_(ScrEv_return_shop_cart) the cart .

 I also quickly check_(RelNScrEv) my bathroom to see_(UnrelEv) if I need_(RelNScrEv) anything in there : toilet paper , soap , deodorant , etc. .
 I do_(UnrelEv) this because I can buy_(Evoking) both_(Evoking) sets_(Evoking) of_(Evoking) items_(Evoking) at_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) store_(Evoking) in the same trip .
 I make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of these things on a piece of paper or type_(ScrEv_make_list) them in my phone , so I can easily recall_(UnrelEv) any of the items I need_(RelNScrEv) without forgetting_(UnrelEv) anything .
 I drive_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store after I prepare_(ScrEv_take_bags) my bags in the trunk .
 Once at the store , I grab_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart , set_(ScrEv_other) my bags in the cart , and place_(RelNScrEv) my phone in the space allocated_(UnrelEv) for the child seat .
 Now I ' m_(UnrelEv) ready to start_(UnrelEv) my grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) : I mechanically go_(ScrEv_move_section) down every aisle and pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up any items I need_(RelNScrEv) from those aisles , all the while keeping_(ScrEv_check_list) an eye on my list to make_(UnrelEv) sure I don ' t forget_(RelNScrEv) anything .
 Once I have_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all my items , I pay_(ScrEv_pay) for the groceries and help_(UnrelEv) bag_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) them up .
 I drive_(UnrelEv) home with my freshly bought_(RelNScrEv) groceries , and go_(UnrelEv) about putting_(RelNScrEv) them away in their respective places once home .

 This has_(UnrelEv) been a great adventure going_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) store_(Evoking) with grandma .

 Last night I realized_(UnrelEv) I did not have_(UnrelEv) anything for dinner .
 To solve_(UnrelEv) this conundrum I first thought_(UnrelEv) about ordering_(UnrelEv) out food .
 This , I realized_(UnrelEv) , was_(UnrelEv) too expensive as I am a broke college graduate just trying to get_(UnrelEv) by .
 I settled_(UnrelEv) on an alternative , going_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store to purchase_(ScrEv_get_groceries) food .
 I walked_(ScrEv_go_grocery) down the street from my apartment to the Whole Foods in the brisk spring air .
 I was_(UnrelEv) on a mission , purchase_(ScrEv_get_groceries) delicious food .
 When I reached_(ScrEv_go_grocery) the Whole Foods , the distinct smell of smug filled_(UnrelEv) my nostrils .
 Organic , natural , non deoderized_(UnrelEv) humans paced_(ScrEv_move_section) to and fro within the confines of the kale infused_(UnrelEv) shelving units .
 I quickly scuttled_(ScrEv_move_section) to the small frozen foods section to purchase_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some ` healthy ' junk food .
 I selected_(ScrEv_get_groceries) chicken tenders and a small frozen pizza .
 Skirting_(UnrelEv) the weed smoking_(UnrelEv) hippies throughout the store I returned_(ScrEv_move_section) to the front .
 I quickly made_(ScrEv_get_groceries) my purchase and sprinted_(ScrEv_leave) back towards home to concoct_(UnrelEv) my wonderfully delicious tendies and pizza .

 I love_(UnrelEv) going_(ScrEv_go_grocery) grocery shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) !
 Usually I am going_(ScrEv_go_grocery) with my ten month old son while my husband is_(UnrelEv) at work .
 before I go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) , I make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of what we need_(RelNScrEv) or else I will buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) things that I do not need_(RelNScrEv) .
 I check_(RelNScrEv) sales to make_(UnrelEv) sure I get_(RelNScrEv) the best deals on things and make_(UnrelEv) a meal plan .
 Then I get_(UnrelEv) my son in the car and we drive_(ScrEv_go_grocery) over the the grocery store .
 We get_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart and I put_(UnrelEv) my son in it .
 I give_(UnrelEv) him a toy and secure_(RelNScrEv) it to the cart after I wipe_(UnrelEv) it down to make_(UnrelEv) sure its clean , and we enter_(ScrEv_enter) the store .
 We go_(ScrEv_move_section) through the store and using_(RelNScrEv) my list grab_(ScrEv_get_groceries) what I need_(RelNScrEv) .
 Since i usually go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) two or more times a week , I only spend_(RelNScrEv) about 3 minutes there before I have all we need_(RelNScrEv) and can pay_(ScrEv_pay) .
 Then we go_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) back out to the car .
 I put_(UnrelEv) my son back in his car seat and the bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) groceries in the trunk and head_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 The other day I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) store_(Evoking) to buy_(RelNScrEv) enough food for me to eat_(UnrelEv) for several days .
 Before I left_(UnrelEv) , I thought_(UnrelEv) about what I might want_(UnrelEv) to eat_(UnrelEv) over the next few days .
 I looked_(UnrelEv) through my recipes and decided_(RelNScrEv) on what sort of food to buy_(RelNScrEv) .
 I got_(UnrelEv) a piece of paper and a pencil and wrote_(ScrEv_make_list) down all the food that I would need_(RelNScrEv) to buy_(RelNScrEv) to make_(UnrelEv) these meals .
 Once I felt_(UnrelEv) my list was_(UnrelEv) complete , I gathered_(ScrEv_take_bags) some bags and drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart and pushed_(ScrEv_enter) it into the store .
 In the store , I looked_(ScrEv_check_list) at my list again and thought_(UnrelEv) about what foods might be_(UnrelEv) near the front of the store .
 The front of the store had_(RelNScrEv) fruits and vegetables , so I looked_(RelNScrEv) for fruits and vegetables on my list so I could pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them up together .
 I walked_(ScrEv_move_section) down the aisle and found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the items on my list and put_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them in my shopping cart .
 I put_(ScrEv_check_off) a check mark next to each item after I found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) it .
 When I got_(ScrEv_move_section) to the next aisle , I looked_(UnrelEv) at my list again and did_(UnrelEv) the same thing .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) about the foods that would be_(UnrelEv) in this aisle and found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them together .
 After going_(ScrEv_move_section) down all the aisles , I saw_(UnrelEv) that every item on my list had_(UnrelEv) a check mark , so I knew_(UnrelEv) I was done_(UnrelEv) shopping_(RelNScrEv) .
 I pushed_(ScrEv_go_checkout) my shopping cart to the checkout lane and gave_(ScrEv_other) each item to the cashier .
 He scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) them and told_(UnrelEv) me how much money the food costs_(RelNScrEv) .
 I gave_(ScrEv_pay) him enough money to pay_(ScrEv_pay) for the food and then helped_(UnrelEv) him put_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) everything into my bags .
 Then I carried_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the bags to my car and drove_(UnrelEv) home .
 I spent_(UnrelEv) the next few minutes putting_(RelNScrEv) all the food away where it belongs_(UnrelEv) , and I was all done_(UnrelEv) shopping_(RelNScrEv) .

 I was hosting_(UnrelEv) a party and needed to pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some groceries for my guests .
 I started_(UnrelEv) by making_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of all the food I needed to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 Then I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_bags) my reusable shopping bags and drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store .
 I chose_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart from outside and picked_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) a copy of the grocery store ad from the front of the store .
 I walked_(ScrEv_move_section) through all the aisles pushing_(RelNScrEv) my cart .
 I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the food I needed_(UnrelEv) from my list , making sure to choose_(ScrEv_get_groceries) food that was_(UnrelEv) on sale or generic food .
 When I had checked_(ScrEv_check_off) everything off on my list , I got_(ScrEv_go_checkout) in line at the store checkouts .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a friendly cashier who scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) all of my groceries and told_(RelNScrEv) me how much money it cost_(RelNScrEv) .
 There was_(UnrelEv) also a friendly bagger who put_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) all on my groceries in my bags .
 At the end , the bagger offered_(UnrelEv) to help_(UnrelEv) put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) all of my groceries in the cart .
 As I left_(ScrEv_leave) the parking lot , I waved_(UnrelEv) goodbye to him after my successful trip .

 Yesterday , I went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) grocery shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 Before I had left_(ScrEv_go_grocery) , I made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of most of the things that I needed_(RelNScrEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) for the week .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) at the sales advertisement that had come_(UnrelEv) in the mail and made_(UnrelEv) a note of a few things that were_(RelNScrEv) on sale .
 I needed_(RelNScrEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) milk , bread , eggs , coffee , and some items to make_(UnrelEv) lunches for me to take_(UnrelEv) to work for the week .
 When I got_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store , I first went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the deli and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out some lunch meat .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some turkey , ham , and salami .
 I then picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up some cheddar cheese .
 Near the deli , I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some bread , which happened_(UnrelEv) to be_(RelNScrEv) on sale .
 A few isles over , I found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some decent coffee that was_(RelNScrEv) not on sale .
 My shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) was_(RelNScrEv) almost complete after I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up a half gallon of milk and a dozen eggs .
 I saw_(UnrelEv) that the yogurt was_(RelNScrEv) on sale , so I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a few of those in my favorite flavors .
 I was trying_(UnrelEv) to find_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some other things to make_(UnrelEv) my lunch with , so I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some bananas .
 I also picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up a bag of chips .
 It looked_(UnrelEv) like I had_(UnrelEv) everything that I needed_(RelNScrEv) for making_(UnrelEv) lunches for the week .
 I was_(UnrelEv) ready to leave_(ScrEv_leave) , so I made_(ScrEv_move_section) my way towards the front of the store .
 I went_(ScrEv_move_section) into the express line because I had_(RelNScrEv) less than twenty items .
 I was finally done_(UnrelEv) and I ended_(UnrelEv) up finishing_(UnrelEv) my shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) in less than a half hour .
 I was pleased_(UnrelEv) with my efficiency .

 We were starting_(UnrelEv) to run_(UnrelEv) out of food so I made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of all the food items we were_(UnrelEv) out of this morning .
 I put_(UnrelEv) on my jacket and shoes , grabbed_(UnrelEv) my keys and left_(UnrelEv) the house .
 I started_(UnrelEv) my car and decided_(UnrelEv) to drive_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to Fred Meyer 's , an excellent grocery store .
 I arrived_(ScrEv_go_grocery) at Fred Meyer 's and walked_(ScrEv_enter) through the cold wind and into the safety of the store .
 There were_(UnrelEv) n't a lot of shoppers around thanks to the weather .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a hand basket and proceeded_(ScrEv_move_section) to the produce section first for apples , bananas and potatoes .
 After that I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the bread section and got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) english muffins and a loaf of wheat bread .
 Next I proceeded_(ScrEv_move_section) to the frozen food section for a frozen pizza .
 The basket was starting_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) full and heavy but I only had_(UnrelEv) two more items left : milk and cheese .
 I headed_(ScrEv_move_section) for the dairy section , acquired_(ScrEv_get_groceries) my last few items and proceeded_(ScrEv_move_section) to checkout .
 Despite the store being_(UnrelEv) not very busy the traditional checkout lines were_(RelNScrEv) all full so I used_(ScrEv_pay) the self-checkout .
 I got_(ScrEv_pay) my receipt and my bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) items and headed_(ScrEv_leave) home to cook_(UnrelEv) lunch .

 One of my favorite weekly activities is_(UnrelEv) going grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 Yesterday afternoon I took_(ScrEv_go_grocery) a casual stroll to my local Whole Foods and could not resist_(UnrelEv) their tempting_(UnrelEv) and rather delicious items .
 My favorite place is_(UnrelEv) the bakery .
 From the warm , freshly baked_(RelNScrEv) chocolate chip cookies , to the elaborate berries and cream cakes , there is_(UnrelEv) not a product that does not disappoint_(UnrelEv) .
 Another section I perused_(ScrEv_move_section) was the prepared_(UnrelEv) food section .
 From pizza , tacos , a salad bar , and fried chicken , there was_(UnrelEv) plenty to choose from .
 My eyes wandered_(UnrelEv) to the burrito bar , as I glanced_(UnrelEv) at the grilled chicken , steak and fajita vegetables .
 I ordered_(ScrEv_other) a grilled steak burrito stuffed_(RelNScrEv) with cheese , hot sauce , salsa , and guacamole .
 After I paid_(ScrEv_pay) the kind chef who created_(RelNScrEv) it , I took_(RelNScrEv) one large mammoth bite and dug_(UnrelEv) in .
 It was_(UnrelEv) one of the most delicious burritos I had ever tasted_(RelNScrEv) .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure to definitely come_(RelNScrEv) back next time !

 On last Sunday morning my wife woke_(UnrelEv) me up and told_(UnrelEv) me its 11 o'clock and time to to get_(UnrelEv) up .
 But I was_(UnrelEv) very lazy on that day and I want_(UnrelEv) to spend_(UnrelEv) some more time on bed .
 I asked_(UnrelEv) my wife to get me some coffee .
 She brought_(UnrelEv) a very tasty hot coffee .
 Its aroma is spreading_(UnrelEv) everywhere in my room .
 After having_(UnrelEv) the coffee I got_(UnrelEv) up and took_(UnrelEv) a good shower .
 That time my wife prepared_(UnrelEv) breakfast for me .
 So I had_(UnrelEv) my breakfast and spent_(UnrelEv) some time for reading_(UnrelEv) news online .
 Then My wife came_(UnrelEv) to me and asked_(UnrelEv) what is_(UnrelEv) my plan for our son 's birthday .
 I told_(UnrelEv) her , '' `` oh !
 I forgot_(UnrelEv) .
 we have to plan_(UnrelEv) something .
 That is_(UnrelEv) on next Saturday '' '' .
 At last I reached_(UnrelEv) a conclusion that this time I cook_(UnrelEv) food by myself .
 So we need to make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list for groceries for that .
 My wife helped_(UnrelEv) me to prepare_(ScrEv_make_list) a list .
 These days groceries are_(RelNScrEv) very pricey .
 So I checked_(ScrEv_other) the deals online .
 At last I found_(RelNScrEv) good deals in a grocery shop near my house .
 So me and my son went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the shop .
 My son likes_(UnrelEv) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) very much .
 When we reached_(ScrEv_go_grocery) the grocery shop , I asked my son to sit_(RelNScrEv) in the cart .
 While we were moving_(ScrEv_move_section) inside the shop , I felt_(UnrelEv) happy by seeing the deals of the day .
 Most of the groceries in my list are_(RelNScrEv) on sale .
 I bought_(RelNScrEv) almost everything in my list .
 I saved_(RelNScrEv) a lot on that day because of the deal .
 After paying_(ScrEv_pay) the bill , we went_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) out of the shop and kept_(UnrelEv) everything inside the car and left_(ScrEv_leave) to home .

 The last time I went_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) , I had_(UnrelEv) a list of things I needed_(UnrelEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 My teenage son needed_(UnrelEv) ingredients for yakisoba for a potluck dinner that his Japanese class at school was having_(UnrelEv) .
 For this I needed_(UnrelEv) refrigerated yakisoba noodles , green onions , and chicken .
 We were_(UnrelEv) also out of eggs , bread , and few other things .
 My list was written_(ScrEv_make_list) on a post-it note stuck_(UnrelEv) to my refrigerator .
 I took_(UnrelEv) the note , got_(ScrEv_take_bags) my purse , and drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store .
 The store is_(UnrelEv) only about 5 minutes away but it was raining_(UnrelEv) , so I did n't want to walk_(ScrEv_go_grocery) .
 I got_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a small cart because I was n't buying_(Unclear) very many things .
 Just inside the entrance to the store is_(UnrelEv) the bread section , so I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) that first .
 Then I bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some chicken breasts , got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a package of 18 eggs , and went_(ScrEv_move_section) to find_(RelNScrEv) where the yakisoba noodles are kept_(UnrelEv) .
 I had n't bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them from that store before .
 I had to walk_(ScrEv_move_section) around_(ScrEv_move_section) a little bit , but I finally found_(RelNScrEv) them and got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) two packages .
 Then I walked_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the self-checkout area , swiped_(RelNScrEv) my grocery store card so that I would get_(RelNScrEv) any member discounts , and checked_(ScrEv_pay) out_(ScrEv_pay) and bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) my groceries .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) with an ATM card and carried_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the groceries out to the car .
 I put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) them on the passenger seat in front .
 Then I drove_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 Every Saturday I do_(UnrelEv) a chore I actually really enjoy_(UnrelEv) - grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) !
 This past Saturday was_(UnrelEv) no exception , so I began_(UnrelEv) to plan_(UnrelEv) my outing_(UnrelEv) .
 I always begin_(UnrelEv) by surveying_(RelNScrEv) my refrigerator and cabinets .
 What food do I already have_(UnrelEv) and what do I need_(RelNScrEv) ?
 There are_(UnrelEv) certain basic things I get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) almost every week .
 At this point I begin_(UnrelEv) to make_(ScrEv_make_list) a written_(UnrelEv) list to bring_(RelNScrEv) with .
 This week I also had_(UnrelEv) a birthday party to shop_(RelNScrEv) for so extras like cake mix and a can of frosting went_(RelNScrEv) on my list .
 Once the list was done_(ScrEv_make_list) I headed_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) a short drive , and once there I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart and begin_(UnrelEv) to head_(ScrEv_move_section) down the aisles .
 Produce then canned_(UnrelEv) goods then meats .
 After that on to dairy and dried_(UnrelEv) goods , and even cleaning products .
 Finally it was_(UnrelEv) off to the frozen_(UnrelEv) aisles , I needed_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) ice cream_(UnrelEv) for the party !
 With a full cart I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the cash register , loaded_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) all the food on the convener belt , and then paid_(ScrEv_pay) for the groceries as a boy bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) everything .
 Another Saturday 's chore was done_(UnrelEv) !

 The previous night and this morning before work I noticed_(UnrelEv) I was missing_(UnrelEv) a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals .
 I planned_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) a trip to the grocery store immediately after work .
 After I finished working_(UnrelEv) I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) over to the store .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very crowded but not too hard to find_(RelNScrEv) a parking spot .
 Once inside the store , I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) the nearest shopping cart and smiled_(UnrelEv) as one of the grocery workers welcomed_(UnrelEv) me in .
 Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought_(UnrelEv) about what I needed_(UnrelEv) .
 Since I did n't have_(UnrelEv) a list written_(ScrEv_make_list) down_(ScrEv_make_list) , it took_(UnrelEv) me a few minutes .
 Once I came_(Unclear) up_(Unclear) with the list in my head , I started to map_(UnrelEv) out a route in my head that would take_(UnrelEv) the least amount of time for me to follow_(UnrelEv) in the store .
 First , I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) my deli .
 They offered_(RelNScrEv) me some free samples of the meat I asked_(RelNScrEv) for .
 Then I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) my bread which was_(UnrelEv) right nearby .
 At the back wall of the store I found_(RelNScrEv) the meat I was going to cook_(UnrelEv) tonight .
 After that , I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a few extra items that I thought_(UnrelEv) might also be_(UnrelEv) nice later this week while heading_(ScrEv_go_checkout) towards checkout .
 Luckily , there was_(UnrelEv) n't a line and this was done_(UnrelEv) quickly .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) with my debit card and left_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) with all my groceries in a cart , packed_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) them into my car , and headed_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 We began_(UnrelEv) by driving_(ScrEv_go_grocery) past the overloaded_(UnrelEv) parking lot dreading_(UnrelEv) finding_(RelNScrEv) a parking spot .
 Luckily we know_(UnrelEv) of a spot on the side of the grocery_(Evoking) store_(Evoking) that is_(UnrelEv) almost always vacant .
 My girlfriend and I park_(RelNScrEv) in our normal spot and walk_(ScrEv_enter) inside .
 The store is booming_(RelNScrEv) with people and all the lines are_(RelNScrEv) full .
 We are_(UnrelEv) the type of people who do not like_(UnrelEv) a lot of people so we wanted_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_enter) in and out as fast as we could .
 Quickly we get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all the groceries marked_(RelNScrEv) down on the list and we head_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the checkout line .
 We found_(UnrelEv) a shorter line that was_(UnrelEv) for a lesser amount of groceries .
 Luckily we had_(ScrEv_get_groceries) 2 items less than the maximum for the line , so we hopped_(ScrEv_go_checkout) in and quickly got checked_(ScrEv_pay) out and on our way .
 I carried_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the groceries out to the car rather than having the employees do_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) it because there are_(UnrelEv) much less able people who need_(UnrelEv) there help more than I do_(UnrelEv) .
 Finally we headed_(ScrEv_leave) home and used_(UnrelEv) our groceries to cook_(UnrelEv) dinner .

 Upon the realization I was_(UnrelEv) out of milk and had_(UnrelEv) nothing to make_(UnrelEv) for dinner , I decided_(UnrelEv) to stop_(ScrEv_go_grocery) at the grocery store .
 It was_(UnrelEv) down the street from my apartment , so I hopped_(UnrelEv) into my car and was_(UnrelEv) there within minutes .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a basket and headed_(ScrEv_move_section) to the back right corner to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some ground beef , then headed_(ScrEv_move_section) to the back left to grab_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some milk .
 My journey then continued_(ScrEv_move_section) to the produce department where I snagged_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some broccoli and onions .
 With my eyes fixed_(UnrelEv) on the checkout line , I headed_(ScrEv_go_checkout) in that direction trying to keep_(UnrelEv) my eyes away from the ice cream section .
 I failed_(UnrelEv) and took_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some chocolate ice cream , went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to check out .
 The line was_(UnrelEv) long , my eyes then wandered_(UnrelEv) to the tabloids while the line moved_(ScrEv_wait) forward .
 I put_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) my products onto the conveyer belt and smiled_(UnrelEv) at the check out lady .
 After I typed_(UnrelEv) in my phone number for a slight discount , I swung_(UnrelEv) my purse around me to get_(RelNScrEv) my wallet and paid_(ScrEv_pay) .
 I took_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) my bags of stuff and walked_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) to my car .

 Last weekend , I went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to KeyFood by myself .
 It 's a grocery store with a good selection of reasonably priced_(RelNScrEv) items .
 I had made_(ScrEv_make_list) a grocery list in advance .
 I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to KeyFood at 2pm .
 I parked_(RelNScrEv) in the parking lot .
 I exited_(RelNScrEv) my car and locked_(RelNScrEv) it .
 I walked_(ScrEv_enter) to the entrance and grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart .
 I pushed_(ScrEv_move_section) the shopping cart into the store and began_(UnrelEv) to search_(ScrEv_move_section) for the items on my list .
 I walked_(ScrEv_move_section) through each isle .
 I gathered_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all the items from my grocery list .
 When I was finished_(UnrelEv) , I pushed_(ScrEv_move_section) my cart to the cashier to pay_(ScrEv_pay) for my groceries .
 I placed_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) the items in front of the cashier so that he could account_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) for my purchases .
 He tallied_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) my total .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) the total amount for the groceries and he gave_(ScrEv_pay) me my change back .

 I love_(UnrelEv) to save_(RelNScrEv) money everywhere I can , a penny saved_(RelNScrEv) a penny earned_(UnrelEv) kind of philosophy .
 So when I analyzed_(UnrelEv) our finances I saw_(UnrelEv) we could save_(RelNScrEv) a considerable amount of money by doing_(Evoking) more_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 I set_(UnrelEv) up our strategy to go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) every weekend and budget_(UnrelEv) about 200 dollars for the two of us each week .
 We like_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to Publix .
 We will start_(UnrelEv) off buying_(ScrEv_get_groceries) produce , fruits and vegetables and such .
 Then we move_(ScrEv_move_section) over and look_(RelNScrEv) for the best deals on meat .
 We usually get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) fish , beef , chicken and pork .
 Next we 'll head_(ScrEv_move_section) over towards dairy and eggs .
 I like_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the 18 packs of eggs .
 They are_(UnrelEv) protein loaded_(UnrelEv) and super cheap .
 I 'll pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up some cottage cheese and about 4 to 6 pounds of cheese .
 We then get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a couple of things out of the frozen section .

 Last Saturday I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 We seemed to be_(UnrelEv) out of a number of things in our house that we needed to cook_(UnrelEv) with , so I sat_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) a made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of items .
 It seemed to be_(UnrelEv) really large , so I knew_(UnrelEv) I would be_(UnrelEv) gone for a while .
 I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store that I like the best , and parked_(RelNScrEv) my car .
 I got_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a large shopping cart instead of the smaller one , since I knew_(UnrelEv) I had_(UnrelEv) a lot of items to purchase_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 Very slowly , I went_(ScrEv_move_section) up and down each row in the grocery store .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_list) my list on each row , and got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the items that I needed_(UnrelEv) .
 I made sure to cross_(ScrEv_check_off) the item off when I put_(ScrEv_get_groceries) it in my cart , so I knew_(UnrelEv) that I did n't forget_(UnrelEv) anything .
 Along the way , I saw_(RelNScrEv) some items that were_(UnrelEv) on sale , and decided_(UnrelEv) to purchase_(ScrEv_get_groceries) those as well , knowing we would use_(UnrelEv) them .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the cold and frozen items last , so they would still be_(UnrelEv) cold by the time I got_(ScrEv_leave) home .
 When I had crossed_(ScrEv_check_off) off_(ScrEv_check_off) everything on my list , I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the front of the store .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) an open cash register lane , and put_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) my items on the conveyor belt .
 The cashier was_(UnrelEv) very friendly and said_(RelNScrEv) hello .
 She began scanning_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) each of my items , and even had to weigh_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) some of them .
 A nice man was putting_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) my groceries into bags for me , and putting_(RelNScrEv) them in my cart as he filled_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) the bags .
 When they were_(UnrelEv) done , I paid_(ScrEv_pay) the cashier the amount due , and she gave_(RelNScrEv) me my change , which I put_(RelNScrEv) in my purse .
 The bagger walked_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) with me out to my car and helped_(UnrelEv) me put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the groceries in the trunk of my car .
 I said_(RelNScrEv) thank you to him , and then drove_(ScrEv_leave) home .
 When I got_(ScrEv_leave) there , it took_(UnrelEv) a while to bring_(RelNScrEv) all of the bags inside , but my children helped_(UnrelEv) me .
 We all had_(UnrelEv) fun putting_(RelNScrEv) the groceries away , and were_(UnrelEv) glad the shelves were_(UnrelEv) filled with what we needed_(UnrelEv) again .

 I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store , parked_(RelNScrEv) , and went_(ScrEv_enter) into the building .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a line of shopping carts at the front of the store , just inside the doors .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) one and walked_(ScrEv_move_section) to the wide produce aisle at the left of the store .
 I walked_(ScrEv_move_section) down_(ScrEv_move_section) every aisle in the store , adding_(ScrEv_get_groceries) things to my cart as I did_(UnrelEv) .
 I had_(UnrelEv) a shopping list with me and managed_(UnrelEv) to find_(ScrEv_check_list) everything I needed_(RelNScrEv) .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) material for making_(UnrelEv) a big salad for dinner : lettuce , tomatoes , peppers , cucumbers , and croutons .
 And I bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) two packages of chicken and one package of hamburg .
 I also bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) things like paper towels and toilet paper and frozen food .
 When I was finished_(UnrelEv) adding_(ScrEv_get_groceries) items to my cart , I walked_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to one of the registers .
 There are_(UnrelEv) more than twenty registers in the store .
 I chose_(RelNScrEv) the one with the shortest line .
 When it was_(ScrEv_wait) my turn I put_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) the things I had_(UnrelEv) in my cart onto the conveyor belt .
 The woman at the cash register scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) the items , and a man at the end of the counter put_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) my items in plastic bags .
 When she was finished_(UnrelEv) scanning_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) my order , she told_(RelNScrEv) me how much I owed_(ScrEv_pay) .
 I swiped_(ScrEv_pay) my credit card into the machine .
 The machine approved_(RelNScrEv) my card , and I signed_(RelNScrEv) the machine with a special pen .
 The bagger had finished_(UnrelEv) bagging_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) my items by then and had put_(RelNScrEv) all the bags in my shopping cart .
 I left_(ScrEv_leave) the store to put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the bags in my car .

 When I went_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) I started_(UnrelEv) by looking_(RelNScrEv) in my refrigerator and figuring_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) what I needed to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 I made_(ScrEv_make_list) a shopping list based_(UnrelEv) on this .
 Then I decided_(RelNScrEv) which store was_(UnrelEv) the best to go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) these items .
 I decided_(RelNScrEv) that Publix was_(UnrelEv) the best and closest store for me .
 I walked_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store with my empty backpack , and when I got_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) the first thing I did_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) check_(ScrEv_move_section) the clearance section and sales .
 After that I walked_(ScrEv_move_section) the aisle , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything that I needed_(RelNScrEv) .
 I avoided_(UnrelEv) using_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart to be_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) that I would not buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) more than I could carry_(RelNScrEv) .
 After picking_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all the items I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the checkout where I paid_(ScrEv_pay) for my purchases in cash .
 After that I put_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) the items in my backpack and walked_(ScrEv_leave) out_(ScrEv_leave) of the store and back to my house .

 Before I go_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) I make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list .
 I actually keep_(UnrelEv) a list going_(UnrelEv) on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever I know_(UnrelEv) I am_(UnrelEv) out or low on something .
 I try to only go_(Evoking) once a week unless there is_(UnrelEv) something I really need_(UnrelEv) for a specific meal .
 I take_(UnrelEv) my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk_(ScrEv_move_section) up and down most aisles just browsing_(RelNScrEv) for anything new or that I might want to try_(UnrelEv) .
 I like to keep_(UnrelEv) a rough estimate of how much I am buying_(RelNScrEv) by rounding_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) .
 So if a can of soup is_(UnrelEv) $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding_(UnrelEv) that as I shop_(Evoking) if I 'm wanting to stay_(UnrelEv) on a specific budget .
 Once I have_(RelNScrEv) all my items in my cart I go_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the checkout line that seems to have_(UnrelEv) the least amount of people in it .
 I do n't like to jump_(RelNScrEv) lines if one line seems to be moving_(RelNScrEv) faster .
 Good to have_(UnrelEv) a little bit of patience .
 I try to remember_(UnrelEv) to bring_(ScrEv_take_bags) my bags with me so that I 'm not always getting_(RelNScrEv) plastic bags .

 I always make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list to make sure I do n't forget_(UnrelEv) anything .
 I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) store_(Evoking) about lunch time .
 When I got_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store , I made sure I had_(UnrelEv) my list and money and got_(RelNScrEv) out of my car .
 I went_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) and got_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a buggy .
 As I went_(ScrEv_move_section) through the store , I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) things on my list to last_(UnrelEv) me through the week .
 I put_(ScrEv_get_groceries) things like fruit , milk , bread , eggs , and snacks in my buggy .
 I also got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some things that I can make_(UnrelEv) meals with , like meat , vegetables , and macaroni and cheese .
 When I was done getting_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything on the list , I headed_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the front of the store .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a line at the cash register , so I got_(ScrEv_go_checkout) in line to wait_(ScrEv_wait) my turn .
 Once it was_(UnrelEv) my turn , I put_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) all of my items onto the counter for the cashier to ring_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) up_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) .
 She was_(UnrelEv) a very sweet young girl and made_(RelNScrEv) conversation while ringing_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) up_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) my groceries .
 After she rung_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) up_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) and scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) everything , I paid_(ScrEv_pay) her and got_(RelNScrEv) my things back into my buggy .
 Then I was_(UnrelEv) all done !
 I headed_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) to the car to put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) my groceries in the trunk and return_(RelNScrEv) the buggy .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a nice and quick grocery_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) .

 Weekly grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) begins_(UnrelEv) at the local supermarket down the street .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) the closest by with a great selection .
 It may not be_(UnrelEv) the cheapest but nothing compares_(UnrelEv) in how close it is_(UnrelEv) .
 Once I am_(ScrEv_enter) at the store , I usually head_(ScrEv_move_section) straight to the fruits and vegetable sections first .
 I will grab_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all the fruits and veggies that I think_(UnrelEv) I will need_(RelNScrEv) for the week .
 I do n't really go_(RelNScrEv) with a shopping list or anything in mind .
 Usually whatever looks_(RelNScrEv) the freshest or is_(RelNScrEv) on sale is_(UnrelEv) what I tend_(UnrelEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 After selecting_(ScrEv_get_groceries) these items , I will move_(ScrEv_move_section) to the proteins .
 Sometimes it is_(UnrelEv) chicken and sometimes it_(UnrelEv) beef .
 It depends_(UnrelEv) on the vegetables I 've just selected_(ScrEv_get_groceries) to determine_(UnrelEv) which type of protein I will be purchasing_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 Lastly , once those are done_(ScrEv_get_groceries) I will pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the packaged_(UnrelEv) goods such as milk , bread , eggs , and cereal .
 I do n't each_(UnrelEv) much junk food or processed_(UnrelEv) foods so this is_(UnrelEv) basically all I will get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) for a typical trip to the grocery store .

 On Friday , I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) grocery shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 My mother made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of all the items we needed_(RelNScrEv) and I went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them .
 While I was_(UnrelEv) at the grocery store , I looked_(ScrEv_check_list) for everything on the list .
 Some of them were_(UnrelEv) hard to find_(ScrEv_get_groceries) , so I had to ask_(RelNScrEv) a worker where to find_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them .
 They were_(UnrelEv) very helpful and pointed_(RelNScrEv) where to go_(ScrEv_move_section) .
 Some of the items were_(UnrelEv) not available so I had to get_(RelNScrEv) a raincheck .
 After I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all the available items , I had to stand_(ScrEv_wait) on line at the checkout .
 The line was_(UnrelEv) very long and there were no other checkout lines open_(RelNScrEv) .
 It was frustrating_(UnrelEv) because I did not have that much items to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 Meanwhile , there were_(ScrEv_wait) at least four people ahead of me with a lot of items to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 I am_(UnrelEv) very impatient .
 Fortunately , one person ahead of me was_(UnrelEv) kind enough to let me skip_(RelNScrEv) him .
 I was_(UnrelEv) very appreciative .
 Finally , I left_(ScrEv_leave) the grocery store with my items .

 My fridge was_(RelNScrEv) completely empty , so I knew_(UnrelEv) I had to go_(UnrelEv) get_(Evoking) some_(Evoking) groceries_(Evoking) .
 I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) over_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the supermarket and parked_(RelNScrEv) my car .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart from the front of the store and walked_(ScrEv_enter) through the big sliding_(UnrelEv) doors .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) amazing how many kinds of food there are_(UnrelEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) there .
 Luckily , I had made_(ScrEv_make_list) a shopping list before I left_(RelNScrEv) , so I knew_(UnrelEv) exactly what I needed_(RelNScrEv) .
 I walked_(ScrEv_move_section) through the produce section and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some of the best fruits and vegetables .
 I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a gallon of milk from the dairy section .
 Up ahead was_(RelNScrEv) the bakery and some fresh bread .
 Down the middle I was able to pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some baking soda , flour , and other baking supplies .
 I needed_(RelNScrEv) some cereal for breakfast , so I looked_(RelNScrEv) around_(RelNScrEv) until I found_(ScrEv_move_section) that aisle .
 My cart was_(RelNScrEv) just about full when I had_(RelNScrEv) everything I needed_(RelNScrEv) .
 I headed_(ScrEv_go_checkout) for_(ScrEv_go_checkout) the checkout and put_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) all my groceries on the counter .
 The cashier scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) each thing and added_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) my total .
 I handed_(ScrEv_pay) him my money , helped_(UnrelEv) him bag_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) up_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) the groceries , and headed_(ScrEv_leave) out_(ScrEv_leave) .
 I loaded_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) up_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the bags into my car , put_(ScrEv_return_shop_cart) the cart back up , and headed_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 Sunday , my husband and I did our grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 He had a shopping list recorded_(ScrEv_make_list) in his cell phone .
 We arrived_(ScrEv_go_grocery) at the store in the early afternoon , and the first thing we did was get_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart .
 We walked_(ScrEv_enter) in and went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the produce area first , where all the fruit and vegetables are_(UnrelEv) .
 My husband checked_(ScrEv_check_list) the list .
 We only had_(RelNScrEv) bananas on the list , but I said_(UnrelEv) we should get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) things for salad , too , so he picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out bananas and bell peppers while I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) lettuce and radishes and tomatoes .
 Then we went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the deli area and ordered_(ScrEv_other) some sliced turkey .
 The man behind the counter sliced_(ScrEv_other) the turkey for us and measured_(ScrEv_other) it on a scale to give_(ScrEv_get_groceries) us the amount we wanted_(UnrelEv) , then wrapped_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) it up for us .
 Next we visited_(ScrEv_move_section) the bakery area and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out a nice loaf of rye bread to put_(UnrelEv) the turkey on .
 In the canned_(UnrelEv) goods area , we picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out soup and white beans ; then we went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the pasta area to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) pasta and sauce .
 In the meat area , we picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up some chicken breasts and Italian sausage .
 Then we went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the dairy refrigerators and we each picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out some flavors of yogurt we like_(UnrelEv) , and got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) milk and butter and eggs .
 We were nearly done_(UnrelEv) , so my husband checked_(ScrEv_check_list) the list again and we saw we had forgotten_(UnrelEv) tin foil and toilet paper , so we went_(ScrEv_move_section) back and got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) those two things .
 Then we went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the check-out where we put_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) all our groceries on a conveyor belt and the clerk scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) each item in an electronic scanner to find_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) out what it cost_(RelNScrEv) .
 She told_(UnrelEv) us the total , and I swiped_(ScrEv_pay) my bank card through an electronic reader to pay_(ScrEv_pay) .
 Meanwhile , a bagger was putting_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) our groceries into re-usable shopping bags that we had brought_(ScrEv_take_bags) with us .
 He put_(ScrEv_other) the bags back into the cart .
 We got_(ScrEv_get_receipt) a receipt from the clerk and pushed_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the cart out to our car , where we moved_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the bags into the back seat .
 Then my husband put_(ScrEv_return_shop_cart) the cart in little corral in the parking lot that keeps_(UnrelEv) the carts away from people 's cars , and we got_(ScrEv_leave) in our car and went_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 When I go_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) I almost always take_(ScrEv_make_list) a list .
 So for me , the first step to shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) is_(UnrelEv) list making_(ScrEv_make_list) .
 I list_(ScrEv_make_list) what I plan_(UnrelEv) to cook_(UnrelEv) this week , and also cleaning products and similar things .
 My favorite place to shop_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) a huge membership store , for its good prices .
 I pick_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) up_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart just outside the store .
 Then I enter_(ScrEv_enter) , sometimes showing_(RelNScrEv) my membership card to the person at the door and sometimes getting_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) without showing_(RelNScrEv) it .
 I cruise_(ScrEv_move_section) past_(ScrEv_move_section) the impulse items just inside the door , and through the electronics and organic foods sections that come_(ScrEv_move_section) next .
 Next come_(ScrEv_move_section) many aisles with items like light bulbs and pillows .
 Finally I get_(ScrEv_move_section) to_(ScrEv_move_section) the food .
 There are_(UnrelEv) usually people here offering_(RelNScrEv) samples of new food items .
 I often take_(RelNScrEv) some .
 I buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) large packages of chicken or fish that can be frozen_(UnrelEv) .
 Sometimes I buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) fresh bread .
 I continue_(ScrEv_move_section) to the fresh fruit and vegetable section , where I try_(UnrelEv) to restrain_(RelNScrEv) myself to what I can use_(RelNScrEv) .
 Next come_(ScrEv_move_section) the chiller and frozen foods , but I go_(ScrEv_move_section) past_(ScrEv_move_section) hem to pet food and paper goods .
 I get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) frozen food on the way back , and then a few canned_(UnrelEv) food and dry goods .
 The last areas are_(UnrelEv) pharmacy , which I mostly avoid_(UnrelEv) , and the book section , where I 'm_(UnrelEv) apt_(UnrelEv) to linger_(RelNScrEv) .
 Then I wait_(ScrEv_wait) in line for a while , pay_(ScrEv_pay) , and leave_(ScrEv_leave) the store .
 As I leave_(ScrEv_leave) , someone checks_(RelNScrEv) my cart , to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) what 's_(UnrelEv) on my receipt matches_(RelNScrEv) the huge load I am carting_(RelNScrEv) home .

 Yesterday I went_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 I left_(UnrelEv) my house and drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store .
 I parked_(RelNScrEv) the car , walked_(ScrEv_enter) inside and grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) at my list and saw_(UnrelEv) that I needed_(RelNScrEv) some fresh produce .
 I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out the best looking_(UnrelEv) strawberries , they were_(RelNScrEv) on sale_(UnrelEv) for $ 2 a pound .
 I bought_(RelNScrEv) several pounds because my daughter loves_(UnrelEv) fresh strawberries .
 I finished_(UnrelEv) up in the produce section , buying_(RelNScrEv) some things to make_(UnrelEv) a green salad later to go_(UnrelEv) with dinner .
 I then stopped_(ScrEv_move_section) at the meat section and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out some nice cuts of steak for dinner .
 I went_(ScrEv_move_section) into the frozen foods section and found_(UnrelEv) ice cream was_(RelNScrEv) also on sale .
 I bought_(RelNScrEv) vanilla and chocolate .
 I went_(ScrEv_move_section) through the rest of the aisles , consulting_(ScrEv_check_list) my list and picking_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out what my family needed_(RelNScrEv) .
 When I had found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything I needed_(RelNScrEv) , and put_(ScrEv_other) them in my cart , I walked_(ScrEv_go_checkout) over to the checkout lanes .
 I stood_(UnrelEv) in line and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for my turn .
 Finally , it was_(UnrelEv) my turn and the checkout person checked_(RelNScrEv) me out .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) my bill , and walked_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) out to my car with the shopping cart .
 Then I loaded_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the car up with the groceries , returned_(ScrEv_return_shop_cart) the cart and drove_(UnrelEv) home .

 Once a week I go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store to do_(Evoking) some_(Evoking) food_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 Before I left_(RelNScrEv) the house my wife gave_(RelNScrEv) me a list of things that we needed_(RelNScrEv) .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) my shopping cart and the list and started_(UnrelEv) walking_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the supermarket that was_(UnrelEv) 2 blocks away .
 When I got_(ScrEv_enter) there_(ScrEv_enter) I walked_(ScrEv_move_section) up and down the aisles looking_(RelNScrEv) for the items that were_(UnrelEv) on the list .
 As I found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) each item , I placed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them into my shopping cart and crossed_(ScrEv_check_off) them off the list .
 When I finally found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything we needed_(RelNScrEv) I made_(ScrEv_go_checkout) my way towards the check out line to pay_(ScrEv_pay) for the food .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) a cashier that did n't have_(RelNScrEv) anyone on her line and I made_(ScrEv_go_checkout) my way towards her .
 I gave_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) her each item one at a time and watched_(UnrelEv) her scan_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) and place_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) them into bags for me .
 After she was finished_(UnrelEv) she told_(RelNScrEv) me the total amount and I gave_(ScrEv_pay) her the money to cover_(ScrEv_pay) the cost .
 She gave_(ScrEv_get_receipt) me my change and receipt then thanked_(RelNScrEv) me for shopping_(Evoking) .

 There are_(UnrelEv) six people living in my house , so going_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) usually a weekly occurrence .
 I do n't mind_(UnrelEv) doing_(RelNScrEv) it though , because I like_(UnrelEv) picking_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out what food to buy_(RelNScrEv) .
 I usually go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) on the morning with my sister .
 We get_(UnrelEv) in the car and drive_(UnrelEv) over to the closest grocery store which is_(UnrelEv) about three miles away .
 We also take_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of items with us so we do n't forget_(RelNScrEv) what we need to buy_(RelNScrEv) .
 When we arrive_(ScrEv_go_grocery) at the store we park_(RelNScrEv) the car and get_(UnrelEv) out .
 I will grab_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart near the store entrance and then we go_(ScrEv_enter) inside .
 We then take_(RelNScrEv) a look at our shopping list and begin gathering_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all the items .
 It takes_(RelNScrEv) us about 30 minutes to find_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything .
 We then go_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the checkout and pay_(ScrEv_pay) for all the stuff .
 Then we go_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) back to our car and drive_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 It is_(UnrelEv) Saturday morning and my mother wakes_(UnrelEv) me early .
 Every Saturday morning is_(UnrelEv) grocery day .
 My mother likes to shop_(Evoking) by the week .
 The store is_(UnrelEv) huge .
 As we walk_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) we get_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart and start_(UnrelEv) down the 1st aisle .
 Fruits and vegetables all stacked_(UnrelEv) neatly in shelves .
 Potatoes in bags stacked_(UnrelEv) next to the onions .
 Grapes in big bunches .
 This is_(UnrelEv) my favorite aisle .
 I love_(UnrelEv) the colors and the shapes .
 Here you can find_(RelNScrEv) some stuff I have never seen_(UnrelEv) before .
 Star fruit , miniature bananas and blood oranges .
 We spend_(UnrelEv) most of our time here .
 We are_(UnrelEv) vegetarians so we do not go_(ScrEv_move_section) to the meat counter or the dairy aisle .
 We do go_(ScrEv_move_section) to the cereal aisle and I beg_(UnrelEv) my mother every week for a different cereal treat .
 Sometimes she says_(UnrelEv) yes and others no .
 But this week is_(UnrelEv) yes and Frosted Flakes get tossed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) in the cart with delight .
 I am_(UnrelEv) so excited about this that I do not pay_(UnrelEv) much attention to the rest of the trip .
 I help_(UnrelEv) my mom bag_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) the groceries and put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the bags in the trunk of the car .
 When we get_(ScrEv_leave) home it all unloaded_(RelNScrEv) and put_(RelNScrEv) away_(RelNScrEv) and then it is_(UnrelEv) time for some Frosted Flake goodness .

 I was_(RelNScrEv) out of food so I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) local_(Evoking) market_(Evoking) .
 I parked_(RelNScrEv) the car and walked_(ScrEv_enter) to the door .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart on the way .
 Once inside i vowed_(UnrelEv) to stick_(ScrEv_move_section) to the outside edges of the store , away from processed_(UnrelEv) foods .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all my produce and some fresh baked_(UnrelEv) bread .
 I also got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) milk and eggs and cheese .
 I caved_(RelNScrEv) and bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some tortilla chips because I had_(UnrelEv) a mean craving for nachos .
 I also checked_(RelNScrEv) the frozen_(UnrelEv) aisle for cheese taquitos .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) cheese taquitos once , years ago , but had never seen_(UnrelEv) them again .
 I always check_(RelNScrEv) in vain , hoping_(UnrelEv) one day to see_(UnrelEv) them next to the chicken taquitos .
 After I had_(RelNScrEv) all my goods I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the check out line .
 I made_(RelNScrEv) small talk with the cashier after I loaded_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) my items on the the conveyor belt .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) after everything was bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) in my cart .
 Then I left_(ScrEv_leave) for home .

 I like to go_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) and went_(Evoking) yesterday .
 The first thing I did_(UnrelEv) when I arrived_(ScrEv_go_grocery) was park_(RelNScrEv) closest the exit I knew I 'd be using_(UnrelEv) after I 'm finished_(UnrelEv) .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_enter) inside_(ScrEv_enter) and chose_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart .
 Next , I used_(RelNScrEv) the wipes the store provides_(UnrelEv) at the entrance and wipe_(RelNScrEv) off the handle of the shopping cart , and my hands , so I know_(UnrelEv) my hands will stay_(UnrelEv) clean while I choose_(ScrEv_get_groceries) my food .
 Then I took_(ScrEv_check_list) out_(ScrEv_check_list) the shopping list I wrote_(ScrEv_make_list) at home and I started_(UnrelEv) .
 I always start_(UnrelEv) with heavy things like cans and boxes so I can put_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them in the bottom of my cart .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the cold and frozen foods and put_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them into my cart next .
 After that , I chose_(ScrEv_get_groceries) meat and fresh produce as well as things like bread , eggs and chips which need to stay_(UnrelEv) on top of the other food so they wo n't get crushed_(UnrelEv) .
 When I had_(UnrelEv) everything I needed_(UnrelEv) , I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the check out line that seemed_(UnrelEv) the fastest and shortest .
 Then I unloaded_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) my groceries onto the counter so the check out clerk could add_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) the costs .
 I was sure to keep_(UnrelEv) my cold foods together so the clerk would pack_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) them together in bags and keep_(UnrelEv) them cold .
 I gave_(RelNScrEv) her my own cloth bags because it helps_(UnrelEv) the environment by not using_(UnrelEv) paper or plastic .
 Once my groceries were all packed_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) neatly into my cart , I took_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) them to my car , loaded_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) them into my trunk and then put_(ScrEv_return_shop_cart) the empty cart into the cart area .

 I needed_(RelNScrEv) to go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) on my weekly grocery shopping trip last weekend .
 So , I went_(UnrelEv) to my fridge and started_(UnrelEv) to make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of the cold items that I would need_(UnrelEv) .
 Then , I checked_(RelNScrEv) out my cabinet to be_(UnrelEv) sure that I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up a few canned_(UnrelEv) goods that I needed_(RelNScrEv) as well .
 I checked_(RelNScrEv) through my coupons and took_(RelNScrEv) the ones that I needed_(RelNScrEv) .

 After going_(ScrEv_go_grocery) through traffic , I arrived_(ScrEv_go_grocery) at the store and parked_(RelNScrEv) my bike .
 I went_(ScrEv_enter) into the store and grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) one of the smaller carts , since I would not need_(RelNScrEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) too many things this trip .
 I put_(RelNScrEv) my backpack and helmet in the cart and went_(ScrEv_enter) inside .
 I just needed_(RelNScrEv) some cream , milk , eggs , sausage , cheese , and some veggies .
 I dodged_(ScrEv_move_section) around other shoppers and headed_(ScrEv_move_section) towards the veggies .
 Salad blends were_(RelNScrEv) on sale , so I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some up .
 I also grabbed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a nice head of broccoli as well .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the refrigerated section and selected_(ScrEv_get_groceries) my meats and things , being_(UnrelEv) sure to check_(RelNScrEv) for discounted_(RelNScrEv) meats .
 My list was all checked_(ScrEv_check_off) off so I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the self-checkout to pay_(ScrEv_pay) .
 I scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) my items , ran_(RelNScrEv) my coupons , and paid_(ScrEv_pay) .
 I loaded_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) my items into my backpack and put_(UnrelEv) both it and my helmet on and left_(ScrEv_leave) the store .

 Being_(UnrelEv) that we needed_(UnrelEv) food in the house , I went_(RelNScrEv) through the cupboards and refrigerator to see_(RelNScrEv) what was there and made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of what we needed_(UnrelEv) .
 We were_(UnrelEv) almost out of food so it was_(UnrelEv) a long list .
 Then I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store .
 First I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the meat isle and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some juicy steaks and a chicken .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_move_section) the the vegetable isle and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some fresh asparagus , broccoli , and salad fixings .

 I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some chili , soups and stews .
 These are_(UnrelEv) always good to have_(UnrelEv) in the house for a quick meal .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the dairy section and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some sour cream and milk .
 Then I pushed_(ScrEv_go_checkout) the cart to the payment isles and paid_(ScrEv_pay) for the groceries .

 All week long my family had been adding_(ScrEv_make_list) to a list on our refrigerator .
 Sometimes they wrote_(ScrEv_make_list) down what food they wanted_(UnrelEv) , and sometimes it was food we had run_(UnrelEv) out of .
 Today was Saturday , the day I always go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) grocery shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 After putting_(RelNScrEv) the list and a pen in my pocket , I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store and parked_(RelNScrEv) next to a light so that I would be able to find_(UnrelEv) it later .
 On my way into the store I took_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart , because the list was_(UnrelEv) very long !
 The produce section is_(UnrelEv) by the door , and I piled_(ScrEv_get_groceries) broccoli , apples , oranges , and carrots into individual plastic bags , using_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) wire ties to keep_(UnrelEv) the bags closed_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) .
 Then I pushed_(ScrEv_move_section) my cart up and down the aisles , adding_(ScrEv_get_groceries) Kix cereal , Pop Tarts , cans of soup , crackers , bread and cookies to the cart .
 Last was_(UnrelEv) the refrigerated section , where I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up milk and eggs .
 As I went_(ScrEv_move_section) , I crossed_(ScrEv_check_off) items off the list .
 When everything was crossed_(ScrEv_check_off) off I waited_(ScrEv_wait) in a line until a cashier rang_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) up my items and put_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) them in bags .
 After paying_(ScrEv_pay) , I put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) all the bags into the back of my car and went_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 Going_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) a routine task for most people .
 As most groceries nearby now require_(UnrelEv) the use of reusable_(UnrelEv) tote bags rather than offering_(RelNScrEv) paper or plastic bags , the trip usually begins_(UnrelEv) at home with remembering_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_take_bags) along_(ScrEv_take_bags) a tote or two .
 I begin_(UnrelEv) my trip by starting_(ScrEv_move_section) down_(ScrEv_move_section) the aisle to either the far right or left and continuing_(ScrEv_move_section) from there .
 If the store offers_(RelNScrEv) an ad at the door I will usually pick_(RelNScrEv) one up and decide_(RelNScrEv) if there are_(UnrelEv) any deals I wish_(UnrelEv) to take_(Unclear) advantage of .
 Keeping_(RelNScrEv) an eye on my spending_(ScrEv_pay) is_(UnrelEv) importnat , as grocery expenses can add_(ScrEv_pay) up_(ScrEv_pay) quickly .
 If I am doing_(Evoking) major_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) I will use_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart , but if I 'm just stopping_(Evoking) for_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) few_(Evoking) items_(Evoking) , a hand basket will suffice_(RelNScrEv) .
 When paying_(ScrEv_pay) for my items I do_(UnrelEv) my best to find_(RelNScrEv) the shortest line with the fastest checker so I can be_(ScrEv_wait) in_(ScrEv_wait) and out as quickly as possible .

 I went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the corner market with my list of things I needed to buy_(Unclear) .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart and wheeled_(ScrEv_move_section) it up and down the aisles .
 I started_(UnrelEv) at aisle one and went_(ScrEv_move_section) through each one in order to make sure that I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything I needed_(UnrelEv) .
 Fruit and vegetables were placed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) in flimsy plastic bags that the market provided_(UnrelEv) for me .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) eggs and placed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them in the cart 's basket so they would n't get broken_(UnrelEv) .
 All other items were tossed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) in the cart .
 After I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything on my list , I rolled_(ScrEv_go_checkout) the cart to the cashier .
 He scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) all my products and gave_(ScrEv_get_receipt) me a final , total price .
 A grocery bagger put_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) all of my items in paper bags .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) the cashier in cash and he gave_(RelNScrEv) me change .
 I thanked_(RelNScrEv) him , I thanked_(RelNScrEv) the bagger , and then I left_(ScrEv_leave) with my groceries .

 Every Sunday I check_(RelNScrEv) our pantry , fridge and freezer to see_(RelNScrEv) what I need to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) from the grocery store .
 I also have to check_(RelNScrEv) the pet supplies as I have_(UnrelEv) dogs and cats that eat_(UnrelEv) a lot !
 I carry_(UnrelEv) a piece of paper with me and write_(ScrEv_make_list) down_(ScrEv_make_list) what I need to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 I also have_(UnrelEv) an idea of what meals I intend to cook_(UnrelEv) during the week and what ingredients I will need_(UnrelEv) to make_(UnrelEv) those meals , so I add_(ScrEv_make_list) them to the list .
 I know_(UnrelEv) which store or stores I am going to visit_(ScrEv_go_grocery) and I know_(UnrelEv) the layout of the store so I try and make_(ScrEv_make_list) my list in the same order that the items will be found_(RelNScrEv) once I get there .
 I pick_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) up_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart on the way into the store and head_(ScrEv_move_section) for the first aisle that I need to visit_(UnrelEv) .
 Most supermarkets have_(UnrelEv) their frozen foods at one end so I start_(UnrelEv) at the other end as it is_(UnrelEv) best to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) frozen items last so they do n't start to melt_(UnrelEv) while I 'm walking_(ScrEv_move_section) round the store .
 I work_(UnrelEv) my way through my shopping list , selecting_(ScrEv_get_groceries) items off the shelf and placing_(ScrEv_get_groceries) them into my cart , trying not to squash_(UnrelEv) lighter things under heavy things and also making sure I buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) items that have_(UnrelEv) a use by date that is_(UnrelEv) later than the day I intend to use_(UnrelEv) them .
 I am also keeping_(UnrelEv) an approximate idea of how much everything costs_(RelNScrEv) so I have_(UnrelEv) some idea of my total bill .
 When I am_(UnrelEv) done with everything I wait_(ScrEv_wait) at a checkout .
 There is_(UnrelEv) nearly always someone in front of me but the checkout people work_(UnrelEv) fast and I never wait_(ScrEv_wait) for long .
 I place_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) all my items on the conveyor belt and the person on the checkout counter scans_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) them for prices .
 The prices all add_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) on a screen in front of me so I can see_(UnrelEv) how much I am spending_(ScrEv_pay) .
 While the checkout person scans_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) my items another shop assistant packs_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) all my items carefully into bags and places_(RelNScrEv) them back in my cart .
 When I am finished_(UnrelEv) I am always asked_(RelNScrEv) if I need_(UnrelEv) any help taking_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) my bags to the car but I always refuse_(UnrelEv) as I think_(UnrelEv) other people in the store need_(UnrelEv) help more than I do_(UnrelEv) .
 I load_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the car and drive_(ScrEv_leave) home and then have to put_(RelNScrEv) everything into the pantry , freezer or refrigerator .
 That is_(UnrelEv) my least favorite part of grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) !

 Grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) can be_(UnrelEv) a stressful event , but if you come_(ScrEv_go_grocery) prepared_(UnrelEv) then you can usually leave_(ScrEv_leave) without a headache .
 Before we head_(ScrEv_go_grocery) over to the store we need_(RelNScrEv) to make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of all the items that we need_(RelNScrEv) .
 Once you arrive_(ScrEv_enter) at the store if you have_(UnrelEv) a short list make_(UnrelEv) sure to grab_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a basket .
 If you are purchasing_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a wider variety of items then grab_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart .
 I would recommend_(UnrelEv) starting_(Unclear) on the outside perimeter of the store , hitting_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up your dairy , meats , and vegetables .
 While you are working_(ScrEv_move_section) your way clockwise or counter-clockwise you can frequent_(ScrEv_move_section) the aisles in the middle to pickup_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the remainder of items .
 Spending_(RelNScrEv) a lot of time in the aisles can become_(UnrelEv) frustrating_(UnrelEv) since people are more likely to be_(UnrelEv) in your way .
 After you select_(ScrEv_get_groceries) all the items to purchase_(ScrEv_get_groceries) , find_(ScrEv_go_checkout) the shortest checkout line .
 Once you are_(UnrelEv) close enough start_(UnrelEv) piling_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) your groceries on the belt , and take_(ScrEv_pay) out your form of payment .
 Once paid_(ScrEv_pay) , the store will generally bag_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) your groceries for you .
 Now you just need_(UnrelEv) to load_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) your car , drive_(ScrEv_leave) home , and unload_(RelNScrEv) all of your bounty !

 With a family of five it seemed like all we ever did was go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the supermarket .
 Walmart and I built_(UnrelEv) a strong personal relationship .
 Not only did they have_(UnrelEv) household items and clothes that I loved , they had_(UnrelEv) food .
 Every week I spend_(UnrelEv) an hour online printing_(RelNScrEv) and sorting_(RelNScrEv) my coupons .
 It is always to good to grab_(RelNScrEv) extra deals even if it is_(RelNScrEv) just cents off .
 After compiling_(RelNScrEv) my coupons I make_(ScrEv_make_list) my shopping list and break_(RelNScrEv) it down to aisles .
 It 's so amazing that I have been_(UnrelEv) to Walmart so many times that I remember_(UnrelEv) their aisles .
 When I arrive_(ScrEv_move_section) in the food section I start_(UnrelEv) with the middle aisles first and then I work_(ScrEv_move_section) my way around , getting_(ScrEv_get_groceries) milk last .
 Sometimes I have to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) so many things that I leave_(ScrEv_leave) with two or three carts .

 Today I went_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 I do_(UnrelEv) most of my grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) at Wal-Mart .
 Unlike most people , I do n't make_(ScrEv_make_list) a list - I just grab_(RelNScrEv) my wallet and think_(UnrelEv) about what I need_(UnrelEv) , and run_(UnrelEv) to the next bus and go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) !
 Once I 'm_(UnrelEv) there , I made sure I got_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the essentials : milk , cereal , meats , things to make_(UnrelEv) meals with meats , et cetera .

 After that , I got_(ScrEv_go_checkout) in line at self-checkout , scanned_(Unclear) and bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) everything , and paid_(ScrEv_pay) with my debit card .
 After that , I hauled_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) my groceries outside to wait_(UnrelEv) for the bus home , stopping_(UnrelEv) to check_(UnrelEv) the time .
 I played_(UnrelEv) some hand-held video games for about 5 minutes at the bus stop and getting_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) .
 Once I was_(UnrelEv) a block away from home , I got_(UnrelEv) off_(UnrelEv) the bus and carried_(RelNScrEv) my groceries in , putting_(RelNScrEv) cold things in the fridge , frozen things in the freezer , and everything else in the cabinets .

 Luckily , the place was_(UnrelEv) only a block away from my apartment and basically right next door to me .

 I had found_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything I needed_(UnrelEv) for the week , so I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) over to the checkout counters .

 When it was_(UnrelEv) my turn , I took_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) the items out of my cart and placed_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) them on the conveyor belt that brought_(UnrelEv) them up to the cashier .
 She took_(UnrelEv) each item and swiped_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) its bar code over a screen that gave_(UnrelEv) her the price .
 When all the items had been checked_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) out_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) , she told_(ScrEv_other) me what the total would be_(UnrelEv) .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) for the groceries , and then wheeled_(ScrEv_move_section) my cart over to an area where I could place_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) the groceries into my reusable bags .
 Once that was done_(UnrelEv) , I pushed_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the cart through the parking lot to my car , where I loaded_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the bags of groceries into my car , and drove_(ScrEv_leave) home .
 When I got_(RelNScrEv) home , I took_(RelNScrEv) the bags into the house and removed_(RelNScrEv) all the items from them .
 Putting_(RelNScrEv) the groceries away in the cupboards and refrigerator was_(UnrelEv) the final step of grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) day .

 I went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) late last night .
 I like going_(ScrEv_go_grocery) at night because it 's not so crowded_(RelNScrEv) .
 First I made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of the things I needed_(RelNScrEv) then headed_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store .
 Another nice thing about shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) late is that you get to park_(RelNScrEv) right near the door , which makes_(UnrelEv) things easier when you come_(ScrEv_leave) out .
 Once I got_(ScrEv_enter) inside , I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart and took_(ScrEv_check_list) out my list .
 There was_(UnrelEv) nothing out of the ordinary on the list , so I started_(UnrelEv) heading_(ScrEv_move_section) down the aisles just like I always do_(UnrelEv) .
 I always keep_(RelNScrEv) track of the cost of everything I pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out on my tablet as I go_(ScrEv_move_section) so that I know_(UnrelEv) if I can afford_(UnrelEv) anything extra .
 The time a couple thing I needed_(RelNScrEv) were_(RelNScrEv) on sale , so I did have_(UnrelEv) some extra money .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) that I needed_(RelNScrEv) some cookies and headed_(ScrEv_move_section) over the the cookie aisle .
 I looked_(UnrelEv) at the Oreos for a little while , then checked_(RelNScrEv) the other cookies .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) on chocolate chip cookies this time , so I put_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the on top of the other things in my cart and went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) to the checkout lane .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) and got everything bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) , then headed_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) out to my car .
 I got_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) everything in the trunk , put_(ScrEv_return_shop_cart) the cart away and headed_(ScrEv_leave) home to put_(RelNScrEv) my groceries away and have_(UnrelEv) some chocolate chip cookies .

 Yesterday , I went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store to buy_(Evoking) food_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to my locally-owned_(UnrelEv) supermarket , Bet-R , because I like_(UnrelEv) to support_(UnrelEv) small businesses .
 I go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) in the early afternoons when I can to avoid_(UnrelEv) the rush of people going_(ScrEv_go_grocery) after school or work -- that way I do n't have to wait_(ScrEv_wait) in long lines at checkout .
 I brought_(ScrEv_make_list) my shopping list with me : eggs , milk , bread , pasta , and other staples .
 I picked_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) up_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a handbasket as my list was_(UnrelEv) not large and began_(UnrelEv) to peruse_(ScrEv_move_section) the aisles .
 I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything on my list , except one thing .
 They were_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) of my favorite variety of pasta sauce , so I bought_(ScrEv_get_groceries) a new kind to try_(UnrelEv) instead .
 I did not intend_(UnrelEv) to pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up_(ScrEv_get_groceries) anything that was_(UnrelEv) not on my list , but I noticed_(UnrelEv) the pints of strawberries were_(RelNScrEv) very inexpensive and decided_(UnrelEv) to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some as well .
 I was finished_(UnrelEv) in about 20 minutes and got_(ScrEv_go_checkout) in line for checkout .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) for my groceries and packed_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) them in the reusable_(UnrelEv) bag I had brought_(ScrEv_take_bags) along with me .
 Then I returned_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 I was excited_(UnrelEv) for the upcoming_(UnrelEv) party .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that I had_(UnrelEv) a big day ahead of me which would be filled_(UnrelEv) with planning_(ScrEv_make_list) and buying_(ScrEv_get_groceries) groceries .
 i made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of everything that I would need_(RelNScrEv) .
 Chips , dip , pretzels , soda , cheese , crackers , frozen pizza , and frozen mozzarella sticks were_(UnrelEv) just some of the things I needed_(RelNScrEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the supermarket and decided_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a big shopping cart to put_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything in .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_list) my list and then pushed_(ScrEv_move_section) my shopping cart from aisle to aisle .
 I saw_(UnrelEv) that the chips were_(RelNScrEv) on sale so I was able to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) an extra bag .
 After all of the snacks I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the frozen aisle in order to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the pizza and mozzarella sticks .
 It was_(UnrelEv) time for checkout_(ScrEv_go_checkout) so i waited_(ScrEv_wait) on line until it was_(RelNScrEv) my turn .
 The cashier scanned_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) my items and I swiped_(ScrEv_pay) my credit card to pay_(ScrEv_pay) for them .
 She bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) everything up and I was_(UnrelEv) ready to go_(ScrEv_leave) on my way home .

 As I was_(UnrelEv) about to leave_(UnrelEv) for_(UnrelEv) the_(UnrelEv) grocery_(UnrelEv) store_(UnrelEv) , I reminded_(ScrEv_take_bags) myself not to forget_(UnrelEv) my reusable shopping bags .
 I am interested_(UnrelEv) in preserving our environment , so I avoid_(RelNScrEv) paper or plastic bags .
 My market is_(UnrelEv) just up the street , so I use_(UnrelEv) a hand trolley to bring_(RelNScrEv) everything home .
 I took_(UnrelEv) that from the closet , and headed_(ScrEv_go_grocery) out the door .
 The air was_(UnrelEv) fresh and I enjoyed_(UnrelEv) the walk .
 When I entered_(ScrEv_enter) the market , I chose_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart , and hung_(RelNScrEv) my hand trolley from the far end .
 Taking_(ScrEv_move_section) each lane of the market one by one , I checked_(ScrEv_check_list) my list , and gathered_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the dry and canned goods I needed_(RelNScrEv) from the shelves .
 I even decided_(ScrEv_get_groceries) on a few extras , as a treat .
 Making_(ScrEv_move_section) a loop around the outer edges of the store , I visited_(ScrEv_move_section) the bakery , butcher , and deli as well .
 By now , the idea of getting_(UnrelEv) home , and making_(UnrelEv) lunch with some of the deli meat and cheese I had just chosen_(RelNScrEv) , seemed_(UnrelEv) like a lovely idea .
 I made_(ScrEv_go_checkout) my way to the cashier , and was_(UnrelEv) happy to see_(UnrelEv) the line was_(RelNScrEv) very short .
 As I waited_(ScrEv_wait) , I pulled_(RelNScrEv) the coupons from my wallet that applied_(UnrelEv) to my purchases , so I could give_(ScrEv_other) them to the cashier right off .
 As she ran_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) my items across the scanner , I let_(RelNScrEv) her know_(UnrelEv) I had_(UnrelEv) my own bags , and proceeded_(UnrelEv) to bag_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) everything in an organized way , to hang_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) on my hand trolley .
 Having finally paid_(ScrEv_pay) , I rolled_(ScrEv_leave) out of the store with a smile and a wave .

 I added_(ScrEv_make_list) any items and left_(RelNScrEv) my house .

 With my list in hand , I start_(UnrelEv) shopping_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the middle isles first , since I want to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) my refrigerated_(UnrelEv) and frozen_(UnrelEv) items last , do n't want them getting_(UnrelEv) warm or thawing_(UnrelEv) before I even get_(RelNScrEv) them home .

 I was running_(UnrelEv) low on food , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) store_(Evoking) .
 First I wrote_(ScrEv_make_list) down a list of everything I would need_(UnrelEv) .

 I parked_(RelNScrEv) where I could find_(UnrelEv) a space and headed_(ScrEv_enter) into the store .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart and went_(ScrEv_move_section) over to the bread section .

 After that , I looked_(UnrelEv) at all the fruits and vegetables .
 I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out a bag of oranges and kept going_(UnrelEv) .

 Once I finished_(UnrelEv) finding_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything on my list , I went_(ScrEv_move_section) over to the check out lines .

 Most people grocery_(Evoking) shop_(Evoking) once a week .
 In my house that really does n't work_(UnrelEv) for us ; my wife and I work_(UnrelEv) shifts that could change_(UnrelEv) and we never know_(UnrelEv) when our son will or wo n't be_(UnrelEv) home so when I shop_(ScrEv_go_grocery) for groceries it 's only looking_(UnrelEv) one or two days ahead .
 There 's two places that I usually go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) for my groceries ; I either shop_(ScrEv_go_grocery) at Wegmans , which is a grocery store near where I work_(UnrelEv) , or Walmart , of which there are_(UnrelEv) two near me , about equal distances from where I work_(UnrelEv) .
 I 'll talk_(UnrelEv) to my wife before I leave_(UnrelEv) work , we 'll decide_(UnrelEv) on dinner and then I 'll go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to whichever store I decide_(UnrelEv) on -LRB- for example , if we 're having_(UnrelEv) fresh meat we prefer_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) it at Wegmans , but if we 're making_(UnrelEv) a casserole or something similar I can get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) it at Wegmans -RRB- .
 I 'll leave_(UnrelEv) work , head_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to whichever store I 've chosen_(UnrelEv) and , without spending_(UnrelEv) alot of time wandering_(UnrelEv) , get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the exact items I need_(RelNScrEv) , pay_(ScrEv_pay) for them and leave_(ScrEv_leave) .
 To me , grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) is more of a necessity than something I enjoy_(UnrelEv) so I want_(UnrelEv) it done_(UnrelEv) quickly .

 Last weekend , I got_(RelNScrEv) into my car to head_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the grocery store .
 The store I normally go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) grocery shop_(ScrEv_get_groceries) at is Safeway , with the exception of the few times I go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to SaveMart .
 But for this time , I headed_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to Safeway .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart and immediately went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the left of the store like I normally do_(UnrelEv) .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the bread items I needed_(RelNScrEv) along with any breakfast pastries I enjoy_(UnrelEv) buying_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 Like normal , I skip_(ScrEv_move_section) the first four aisles due to them being_(UnrelEv) for personal care and pet care .
 I buy_(RelNScrEv) my personal items elsewhere -LRB- such as shampoo , etc. -RRB- .
 I then went_(ScrEv_move_section) down the beverage aisle where I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up several Gatorades and bottled waters .
 I then continue_(UnrelEv) going_(ScrEv_move_section) up each aisle after the beverage one , where I would pick_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up my frozen foods , canned foods , snacks -LRB- such as chips and cookies -RRB- , and any other lunch items -LRB- frozen or non-frozen -RRB- .
 I then ended_(ScrEv_move_section) with the fruits and vegetables , where I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up a bunch of bananas and about four apples .
 I took_(ScrEv_go_checkout) my cart to the lone open register after waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for about five minutes .

 I wanted to buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) ice cream , but was_(UnrelEv) afraid it would melt_(UnrelEv) , so I passed_(ScrEv_move_section) the freezer aisle and went_(ScrEv_move_section) straight for the bread .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) nice to have_(UnrelEv) good fresh bread for sandwiches , is_(UnrelEv) n't it ?
 Then came_(ScrEv_move_section) the cereal aisle .
 Oatmeal would make_(UnrelEv) a good change for breakfast .

 This way , they will stay_(RelNScrEv) colder together than if I buy_(ScrEv_get_groceries) one cold thing and it 's sitting_(RelNScrEv) by itself in the heat of the car while I shop_(ScrEv_get_groceries) at the next store .
 I park_(RelNScrEv) my car as close as I can to the entrance and grab_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart .
 I begin_(UnrelEv) by opening_(ScrEv_check_list) my list and deciding_(UnrelEv) which part of the store I am going to start_(UnrelEv) in , and then work_(ScrEv_move_section) my way to the other end as I get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the items that I need_(RelNScrEv) .
 I try_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_move_section) quickly so it does n't take_(UnrelEv) much time .
 When I 'm ready , I go_(ScrEv_move_section) to the front of the store and get_(ScrEv_move_section) into a line with a number that is lit up .
 If I have_(ScrEv_get_groceries) less than 10 or 15 items , I will sometimes go_(ScrEv_move_section) to the express lane .
 I wait_(ScrEv_wait) for it to be_(UnrelEv) my turn and unload_(ScrEv_put_conveyor) the groceries onto the conveyor belt .
 After the cashier rings_(ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight) up my items , I will pay_(ScrEv_pay) with either cash or my credit card .
 The items get bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) up and placed_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) into my cart for me .
 I thank_(RelNScrEv) the cashier and take_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the cart to where my car is parked_(RelNScrEv) and put_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the groceries inside it .
 I then go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the next store and get_(ScrEv_get_groceries) any items I need_(RelNScrEv) there .
 I drive_(ScrEv_leave) home and bring_(RelNScrEv) all the groceries inside my house , and then put_(UnrelEv) them all away wherever they go_(UnrelEv) .

 Today is_(UnrelEv) the day of the week I usually go_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 This morning I checked_(UnrelEv) in the refrigerator and threw_(UnrelEv) out any spoiled_(UnrelEv) food and looked_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) what I would need_(UnrelEv) more of this week .
 I thought about what dinners I would have_(UnrelEv) , and how many packed_(UnrelEv) lunches I would need_(UnrelEv) this week .
 I started_(ScrEv_make_list) a list of things to buy_(RelNScrEv) after planning_(UnrelEv) my meals .
 The grocery store is_(UnrelEv) nearby so I took_(ScrEv_take_bags) my reusable bags and my list and walked_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the store .
 I got_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a shopping cart on my way in .
 I selected_(ScrEv_get_groceries) the nonperishables first , then went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the produce section , then the refrigerated , and finally the frozen department .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) through the self checkout line as it seemed_(UnrelEv) a shorter wait_(ScrEv_wait) .
 After scanning_(RelNScrEv) and placing_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) my items in my reusable bags I paid_(ScrEv_pay) by sliding_(RelNScrEv) my credit card , and then took_(ScrEv_get_receipt) the printed_(RelNScrEv) receipt .

 '' `` Going grocery shopping '' '' Going_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) grocery_(Evoking) for me is kind of a burden .
 I like going_(UnrelEv) ahead and getting_(RelNScrEv) everything I need_(RelNScrEv) for at least two weeks .
 The longer I can wait_(UnrelEv) to have to go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) back , the better .
 I normally go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to two different stores .
 One is_(UnrelEv) a traditional grocery store and the other is_(UnrelEv) a dollar store .
 When I go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to the traditional grocery store , I get frustrated_(UnrelEv) because I find_(UnrelEv) it hard to find_(ScrEv_get_groceries) certain things .
 Baking soda is_(UnrelEv) an example .
 One day , I asked_(RelNScrEv) an employee who was working_(UnrelEv) in the baking supplies isle where the baking soda was_(UnrelEv) .
 We could not find_(ScrEv_get_groceries) it .
 Again , this was_(UnrelEv) on the baking supplies isle .
 As I walk_(ScrEv_move_section) through the store looking_(ScrEv_other) for things I need_(UnrelEv) , I 'll see_(UnrelEv) a display of chips or something at the end of an isle .
 This makes me think_(UnrelEv) that there are_(UnrelEv) chips on that isle .
 There are_(UnrelEv) no chips on that isle .
 It 's a good trip when I have_(UnrelEv) everything I need_(RelNScrEv) for a few weeks .

 I needed to do_(UnrelEv) my weekly grocery_(Evoking) shopping_(Evoking) .
 I prepared_(UnrelEv) by first looking_(RelNScrEv) through my cupboards and the refrigerator and freezer to see_(RelNScrEv) what I already had_(UnrelEv) and what I needed_(UnrelEv) .
 Then I made_(ScrEv_make_list) a list by category of everything I needed_(UnrelEv) for the upcoming week .
 I drove_(ScrEv_go_grocery) to Shopper 's Food Warehouse , parked_(RelNScrEv) the car , found_(ScrEv_take_shop_cart) a cart near the front door and went_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) to begin_(UnrelEv) my shopping_(Evoking) .
 I started_(UnrelEv) in the produce section and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out_(ScrEv_get_groceries) everything I needed_(UnrelEv) in the way of fruits and vegetables .
 Then I shopped_(ScrEv_get_groceries) for meats , cheeses , canned goods , milk , eggs , juice , bread , cereal , paper products , and frozen items .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_checkout) through the check-out line with my purchases and paid_(ScrEv_pay) with a credit card .
 The cashier bagged_(ScrEv_pack_groceries) all my items and put_(RelNScrEv) them back in the cart .
 I rolled_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the cart close to my car and unloaded_(ScrEv_bring_vehicle) the bags into the trunk of my car , then went_(ScrEv_leave) home and put_(RelNScrEv) everything away .

 The Empty Refrigerator One evening I returned_(UnrelEv) home from work and realized_(UnrelEv) that I was_(UnrelEv) very hungry .
 However , when I opened_(UnrelEv) the door to my refrigerator , I saw_(UnrelEv) that there was_(UnrelEv) nothing in it besides a gallon of water and a half-used bottle of ketchup .
 I opened_(UnrelEv) my freezer to only find_(UnrelEv) two trays of ice .
 This did not look_(UnrelEv) promising_(UnrelEv) at all .
 Since I was_(UnrelEv) very hungry , I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) out to eat_(UnrelEv) and then go_(ScrEv_go_grocery) grocery shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to eat_(UnrelEv) at a restaurant near my favorite grocery store and then started_(UnrelEv) my grocery shopping_(ScrEv_get_groceries) quest .
 I first went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the produce aisle and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out an assortment of fruits and vegetables .
 I then proceeded_(ScrEv_move_section) to the meat section where I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) out some chicken , pork chops , hamburger , and a beef roast .
 Next , I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up some canned_(UnrelEv) items and some taco shells , taco seasoning , pizza crust mix , and peanut buttter .
 After this , I went_(ScrEv_move_section) to the dairy section and picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up some cheese and milk .
 My next stop was_(UnrelEv) the frozen section where I tossed_(ScrEv_get_groceries) some ready-made meals in my cart along with chicken strips , frozen vegetables , tator tots , and frozen pizza .
 Before I made_(ScrEv_go_checkout) it to the checkout area , I picked_(ScrEv_get_groceries) up a loaf of bread .
 I know_(UnrelEv) had_(UnrelEv) a good assortment of food and it would be_(UnrelEv) a long time before I would come_(UnrelEv) home to an empty refrigerator and freezer again which was_(UnrelEv) a very good thing .

 Every other month , I get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) from my favorite barbershop in the heart of the city .
 I love_(UnrelEv) the barbershop because the haircuts are_(UnrelEv) cheap and the barbers are always making_(ScrEv_small_talk) jokes about ANYTHING .
 Last week , I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the barbershop to get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) with my friend , John .
 John and I took_(ScrEv_get_salon) my car and arrived_(ScrEv_get_salon) there around noon so that my favorite barber would be_(RelNScrEv) there .
 Luckily , my barber and another good barber were_(RelNScrEv) there and ready for us .
 We took_(ScrEv_sit_down) our seats and they draped_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) the long black cloth over our bodies so the hair would n't get_(RelNScrEv) all over us .
 Then , they combed_(ScrEv_comb) our hair so that it made_(UnrelEv) it easier to cut_(ScrEv_cut) it .
 Next , they turned_(ScrEv_cut) on_(ScrEv_cut) their clippers and began_(UnrelEv) cutting_(ScrEv_cut) our hair .
 As they cut_(ScrEv_cut) , they talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) about all the big topics and new of the day .
 There were_(ScrEv_small_talk) plenty of laughs just like I expected_(UnrelEv) !
 After they were done_(RelNScrEv) , they sprayed_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) our hair with sheen , brushed_(ScrEv_brush_hair) us off , took_(ScrEv_remove_cap) off_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the cloth , and showed_(ScrEv_look_mirror) us the finished_(RelNScrEv) product in the mirrors .
 We looked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) great !
 We paid_(ScrEv_pay) them for the haircuts , with a nice little tip added_(ScrEv_leave_tip) on , and left_(ScrEv_leave) the shop .

 I woke_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) and looked_(UnrelEv) at myself in the mirror .
 I realized_(UnrelEv) that my hair was_(UnrelEv) really long and unkempt and that it was_(UnrelEv) time for a hair cut .
 Sometimes , when I do n't get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) , I look_(UnrelEv) like a really scary homeless man .
 This is_(UnrelEv) often because I do n't shave_(RelNScrEv) my big beard either .
 Whenever I get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) , it is when I also get_(UnrelEv) a shave .
 So this means_(UnrelEv) that I am_(UnrelEv) often unshaven for three months straight .
 Since , I wanted to go_(UnrelEv) back into the world again , I knew_(UnrelEv) it was time for a new hair cut and shave .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the neighborhood Barber , Santiago 's , and got_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) and shave .
 He first used_(UnrelEv) scissors to trim_(ScrEv_cut) my hair into something manageable , then he used_(UnrelEv) a electric trimmer to buzz_(ScrEv_cut) some of my side burns off .
 He then continued_(UnrelEv) using_(UnrelEv) his scissors and cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair into something that was_(UnrelEv) acceptable .
 He also had to take_(UnrelEv) a few minutes to shave_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) my beard .
 First he trimmed_(ScrEv_cut) the excess off with his electric trimmer .
 Then he proceeded to use_(UnrelEv) a knife and shaving cream to give_(UnrelEv) me a very deep shave .
 It costed_(RelNScrEv) a total of 50 dollars .
 This was_(UnrelEv) n't bad considering I got_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) new_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) , I was shaved_(RelNScrEv) , and they even offered_(UnrelEv) to wash_(ScrEv_wash) my hair for free .

 This past weekend I went_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 My hair has grown_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) quite a bit and I hate_(UnrelEv) it when it takes_(UnrelEv) too long to dry_(UnrelEv) .
 That 's_(UnrelEv) usually my indication to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) down_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the barber shop near my apartment early in the morning so that I could avoid_(RelNScrEv) the lines .
 This particular time I was_(UnrelEv) the first to arrive_(ScrEv_enter) .
 The barber knows_(UnrelEv) me already so I just hop_(ScrEv_sit_down) into the chair and tell_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) him the usual .
 The usual for me is_(UnrelEv) to just cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair short .
 This involves_(UnrelEv) using_(ScrEv_cut) the trimmer on the back and sides , and then a scissor cut on the top .
 The top I keep_(RelNScrEv) longer otherwise it sticks_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) and is_(UnrelEv) uncontrollable .
 The process takes_(UnrelEv) about 20 minutes but there 's_(UnrelEv) a TV there so I can watch_(RelNScrEv) some of the news while he cuts_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 After the haircut , I pay_(ScrEv_pay) him and leave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) him a pretty good tip since we 've known_(UnrelEv) each other for so long .

 I woke_(UnrelEv) up this morning and decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(Evoking) get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .
 I normally go_(ScrEv_get_salon) to a place that calls_(UnrelEv) for a phone call in advance of arriving_(ScrEv_enter) but this time I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_get_salon) to a different place where I could just walk_(RelNScrEv) in .
 When I arrived_(ScrEv_enter) I had to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for about 10 minutes before someone could cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , which was_(UnrelEv) alright with me since I did not make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment or anything .
 When I got_(ScrEv_sit_down) in the chair the lady cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what kind of haircut I wanted_(RelNScrEv) and I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her short hair on the top with a buzz cut on the sides .
 She told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me that would be_(UnrelEv) a great look for me and I agreed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) .
 During the hair cut I talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) to the barber about what I did_(UnrelEv) in life and asked_(ScrEv_small_talk) her some questions as well .
 After about 10 minutes she finished_(RelNScrEv) the job .
 I tipped_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her 5 dollars for her effort and went_(ScrEv_leave) off satisfied_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) with my haircut .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a good experience .

 We discussed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) what style and length I wanted_(UnrelEv) and I showed_(RelNScrEv) her a picture in a magazine as a reference .
 She placed_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a fabric cape around my neck and directed_(UnrelEv) me to wash bowls .

 I get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) by a person I met_(UnrelEv) when my kids were_(UnrelEv) in preschool with her kids .
 She is_(UnrelEv) the best hair cutter I 've ever been_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) .
 She works_(RelNScrEv) at a nice salon , although she used_(UnrelEv) to cut_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) for cheaper out of her home .
 Now when I go_(ScrEv_get_salon) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) , I call_(ScrEv_make_appointment) the salon to make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment .
 When I arrive_(ScrEv_get_salon) at the salon , I check_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) with the receptionist and she asks_(RelNScrEv) whether I want to wear_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a tunic .
 -LRB- You can take_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) your top and wear_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) one of their tunics if you want to be_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) you do n't get_(RelNScrEv) hair on your top . -RRB-
 I used_(UnrelEv) to_(UnrelEv) , but now I do_(UnrelEv) n't because the tunics are_(UnrelEv) uncomfortable .
 Usually the receptionist asks_(RelNScrEv) whether I want_(RelNScrEv) a glass of lemon water or a cup of tea .
 I ask_(RelNScrEv) for_(RelNScrEv) lemon water .
 Then I sit_(ScrEv_wait) down_(ScrEv_wait) on one of the couches in the waiting area and read_(RelNScrEv) a fashion magazine and sip_(RelNScrEv) my water while I wait_(ScrEv_wait) for my appointment time .
 The person who cuts_(ScrEv_cut) my hair comes_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) to the waiting area to get_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me when it 's_(UnrelEv) time .
 She puts_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a big plastic cape around my neck and washes_(ScrEv_wash) my hair at a sink .
 She gives_(ScrEv_scalp_massage) me a scalp massage , which always feels_(RelNScrEv) great .
 Then she wraps_(ScrEv_put_towel) my head in a towel and we walk_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) to her hair cutting station .
 I have to take_(RelNScrEv) my glasses off , so everything is_(UnrelEv) very blurry .
 First I stand_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) behind the chair and she cuts_(ScrEv_cut) the hair at the nape of my neck .
 Then I sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) down_(ScrEv_sit_down) and she cuts_(ScrEv_cut) the rest .
 After the haircut , she blow-dries_(ScrEv_dry) my hair gently and arranges_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) the curls so that they look_(RelNScrEv) good .
 Then she gives_(ScrEv_look_mirror) me a hand mirror , and I put_(RelNScrEv) my glasses on to see_(ScrEv_look_mirror) what the haircut looks_(RelNScrEv) like .
 While I look_(ScrEv_look_mirror) at it , she sweeps_(ScrEv_other) up the hair from the floor .
 Then she walks_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me back out to the reception area , and I pay_(ScrEv_pay) for the haircut .

 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down , and she put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a cape around my shoulders to prevent_(RelNScrEv) hair from sticking_(RelNScrEv) to my clothes .
 She brought_(ScrEv_prepare_wash) over a cart with a small tub on it , and told_(UnrelEv) me to lean_(ScrEv_prepare_wash) my neck back while she washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair .

 She applied_(ScrEv_other) a special creme to my hair to help_(UnrelEv) nourish_(RelNScrEv) it , and then started_(UnrelEv) snipping_(ScrEv_cut) away .
 Long pieces of my hair fell_(RelNScrEv) all around me to the floor .
 She turned_(RelNScrEv) my chair around so she could reach_(RelNScrEv) the hair in the front of my head , and when she was_(UnrelEv) done she washed_(RelNScrEv) her scissors off .

 I like to have_(UnrelEv) short hair so I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her she could do_(Unclear) whatever she wanted_(UnrelEv) to my hair .
 She shaved_(ScrEv_cut) the sides and back and cut_(ScrEv_cut) the top very close , then used_(ScrEv_cut) thinning_(ScrEv_cut) shears to thin_(ScrEv_cut) out the top of my hair .

 She washed_(ScrEv_wash) and conditioned_(ScrEv_wash) my hair then took_(ScrEv_sit_down) me back to her chair .
 She used_(ScrEv_dry) a blow dryer to dry_(ScrEv_dry) my hair and put_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) product in to make it look_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) shiny and stay_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) in place .
 She gave_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me advice on how to best style_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it and then finished_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) my hair with some hairspray .
 When she was done_(UnrelEv) we went_(RelNScrEv) to the cash register so she could ring_(ScrEv_pay) me up .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) in cash and left_(ScrEv_leave_tip) a large tip because I liked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) the haircut a lot .
 I then left_(ScrEv_leave) the salon .

 A couple of days ago I decided_(UnrelEv) my hair was getting_(UnrelEv) a little to long , so I went_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 I go_(ScrEv_get_salon) to an old-fashioned barber , not a hair salon , so I did n't need to make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment .
 I just drove_(ScrEv_get_salon) there , parked_(UnrelEv) and walked_(ScrEv_enter) in the door .
 There was_(UnrelEv) only one person ahead of me , so I did n't have to wait_(ScrEv_wait) too long .
 I read_(RelNScrEv) a magazine while he finished_(RelNScrEv) the other person , then got_(ScrEv_sit_down) into the chair .
 As usual , he asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) how I wanted_(RelNScrEv) it cut_(ScrEv_cut) and I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) him to do_(UnrelEv) it the same way as always .
 Maybe someday I 'll surprise_(UnrelEv) him and ask_(UnrelEv) for a mohawk or something , but not today .
 He went_(RelNScrEv) to work with the scissors while we talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) a little about sports teams .
 It did n't take_(RelNScrEv) too long before he was done_(RelNScrEv) with the cutting_(ScrEv_cut) and used_(RelNScrEv) the electric trimmer to make_(RelNScrEv) everything neat .
 I go_(RelNScrEv) to an old enough barber that he actually finishes_(RelNScrEv) up with a hot towel and neck massage , which is_(UnrelEv) always nice .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) him and headed_(ScrEv_leave) home a lot neater looking_(UnrelEv) then I was_(UnrelEv) before .

 When I got_(ScrEv_get_salon) there , I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down and saw that there were two other people waiting_(ScrEv_wait) .

 Each one had_(UnrelEv) a customer in it who was already getting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) so I had to wait_(ScrEv_wait) .

 I was looking_(UnrelEv) in the mirror yesterday and noticed_(UnrelEv) that my hair was_(UnrelEv) too long , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .

 Yesterday I visited_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hairdresser_(Evoking) for_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the salon and asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) for a haircut with a wash .
 The receptionist said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) it would be_(ScrEv_wait) a 15 minute .
 I said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) that would be_(UnrelEv) fine , and sat_(ScrEv_wait) down_(ScrEv_wait) .
 On the table in front of me were_(UnrelEv) a selection of magazines .
 I picked_(RelNScrEv) '' `` People '' '' and browsed_(RelNScrEv) through_(RelNScrEv) it as I waited_(ScrEv_wait) .
 Soon , the hairdresser called_(ScrEv_get_called) my name and I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down_(ScrEv_sit_down) in the chair .

 Yesterday , I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to my local barber .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) him I wanted_(UnrelEv) the buzz cut and he sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) me down in the barber 's chair .
 He put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a plastic sheet over my front so that I would n't get_(UnrelEv) hair on my clothes .

 After every few minutes , he asked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) what I thought_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) about the progress .

 Earlier this week I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .
 Over the summer I had just gone_(UnrelEv) for a cheap haircut at Great Clips and I ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) with a bad haircut .
 I went_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) to a nicer place where I had to pay_(ScrEv_pay) more , but I had to do_(UnrelEv) something about the bad cut .
 I had to cut_(ScrEv_cut) most of it off to start_(UnrelEv) over_(UnrelEv) .
 This last cut was_(UnrelEv) the first time I started_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) some of the growth coming_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) and some of the curl !
 Lots of people make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) standing hair appointments , but I prefer_(UnrelEv) to just call_(ScrEv_make_appointment) when my hair was bugging_(UnrelEv) me so once the ends started looking_(UnrelEv) straggly I called_(ScrEv_make_appointment) and went_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) .
 I checked_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) at the front desk and had_(ScrEv_small_talk) a nice chat with the receptionist who is_(UnrelEv) getting ready to go_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) on maternity leave .
 Then my stylist took_(UnrelEv) me back and asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me if I was still growing_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) my hair .
 I said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) I was_(UnrelEv) so she looked_(RelNScrEv) it over and then gave_(ScrEv_scalp_massage) me a nice scalp massage and a shampoo before cutting_(ScrEv_cut) .
 The cut is_(UnrelEv) about the same length as it was_(UnrelEv) the last time I got it cut_(ScrEv_cut) , but it is getting_(UnrelEv) more and more even every time .
 My stylist likes_(UnrelEv) to straighten_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) my hair on each visit so she can make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it is_(UnrelEv) all correct .
 Looking_(UnrelEv) forward to it growing_(UnrelEv) some more .

 Last week I decided_(UnrelEv) that I wanted to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .
 I called_(ScrEv_make_appointment) my hairstylist and made_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment to come_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) .
 On the day of my appointment I drove_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the salon , checked_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) with the receptionist and sat_(ScrEv_wait) down_(ScrEv_wait) and looked_(RelNScrEv) through_(RelNScrEv) a magazine for a few minutes until the stylist came_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) and called_(ScrEv_get_called) my name .
 I followed_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) her back to her booth where she sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) me in a spinning_(UnrelEv) chair in front of a mirror .
 She asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me questions about how I wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) my hair cut_(ScrEv_cut) and I explained_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) it to her .
 Then she took_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me to another chair in front of a small sink where she washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair .
 When she was done_(UnrelEv) , she wrapped_(ScrEv_put_towel) my hair in a towel and took_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me back to the spinning_(UnrelEv) chair .
 She combed_(ScrEv_comb) my hair and then began_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) it .
 Once she was done_(UnrelEv) , she blow-dried_(ScrEv_dry) my hair .
 I looked_(ScrEv_look_mirror) in the mirror and was_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) very happy with my new haircut .
 I thanked_(ScrEv_small_talk) her and gave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a tip , went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) back_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) to the receptionist to pay_(ScrEv_pay) for the haircut , then went_(ScrEv_leave) back_(ScrEv_leave) out to my car and drove_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 My sons Todd 's hair seemed_(UnrelEv) to grow_(UnrelEv) at an exceptionally fast rate compared to other four year olds .
 It seemed_(UnrelEv) as if every single week he needed_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 He would fret_(UnrelEv) every time he knew_(UnrelEv) we were going_(UnrelEv) and even threw_(UnrelEv) tantrums .
 But once we get_(ScrEv_get_salon) there things seemed_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) smoother with him .
 We would grab_(ScrEv_sit_down) a seat and wait_(ScrEv_wait) for our favorite barber to get_(RelNScrEv) an opening .
 As soon as he did_(UnrelEv) Todd would run_(RelNScrEv) up to him and sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) in the chair knowing_(UnrelEv) he would get_(UnrelEv) ice cream if he sat_(UnrelEv) still .
 The barber draped_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a piece of plastic around Todd 's shoulder so that hair would n't get_(RelNScrEv) on his clothes .
 The sound of the hair clippers tiny motor always had_(UnrelEv) my boy on edge but he always sticks_(UnrelEv) it out like a champ .
 Fifteen minutes later a brand new child walks_(ScrEv_leave) out of the barber shop ; clean shaven_(RelNScrEv) and ready for a cool yummy treat .

 I get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) at an inexpensive hair salon where people can not make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) appointments or choose_(RelNScrEv) their stylist .
 So when I get_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the shop , the first thing I do_(UnrelEv) is go_(ScrEv_check_in) up to the desk and give_(ScrEv_check_in) my name .
 Then , I sit_(ScrEv_wait) and wait_(ScrEv_wait) with everyone else until my turn comes_(UnrelEv) .
 Usually I read_(RelNScrEv) magazines and eavesdrop_(UnrelEv) on conversations to pass_(UnrelEv) the time .
 Eventually , a stylist comes_(UnrelEv) and gets_(UnrelEv) me .
 He or she leads_(UnrelEv) me to a chair in a line of chairs in front of a huge mirror .
 She -LRB- it is_(UnrelEv) almost always a woman -RRB- puts_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a plasticized drape around me to keep_(UnrelEv) the hair from going_(UnrelEv) down my blouse .
 During this period , we also greet_(RelNScrEv) one another and tell_(RelNScrEv) each other our names .
 Once she gets me draped_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) she asks_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what kind of cut I want_(UnrelEv) , and I usually ask_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) that she just trim_(ScrEv_cut) what I already have_(UnrelEv) .
 I have_(UnrelEv) short fine hair I wear_(UnrelEv) in a wash and wear style , and I never want_(UnrelEv) it washed_(ScrEv_wash) before it is cut_(ScrEv_cut) .
 She begins cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , usually asking_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) styling questions like whether I want my ears to show_(UnrelEv) and whether I want the bangs feathered_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) .
 As she cuts_(ScrEv_cut) , we chat_(ScrEv_small_talk) about something unimportant , like a dog that runs_(UnrelEv) by the window or a TV show .
 Many times I have talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) to stylists about their children , or mine .
 At the same time , the stylist will exchange_(RelNScrEv) a few remarks with other stylists , and I will spy_(UnrelEv) on other peoples ' haircuts .
 When she finishes_(UnrelEv) , the stylist will give_(RelNScrEv) me a hand mirror so I can inspect_(ScrEv_look_mirror) the back of my head .
 She brushes_(ScrEv_brush_hair) me off and removes_(ScrEv_remove_cap) my drape , and I slip_(ScrEv_pay) her a folded_(UnrelEv) bill .
 Chances are_(UnrelEv) I will never see_(UnrelEv) her again .

 I looked_(UnrelEv) down at the floor at all the hair that flying_(UnrelEv) all over the place .
 I started_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) nervous , wondering_(UnrelEv) if I made_(UnrelEv) a mistake .

 A few weeks ago I decided_(UnrelEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) time for me to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 Normally it is_(UnrelEv) recommended_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) every six months , but I had gone_(UnrelEv) quite a bit longer .
 The ends of my hair were splitting_(UnrelEv) , and my bangs were getting_(UnrelEv) longer than I liked_(UnrelEv) them to be_(UnrelEv) .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_get_salon) back to Great Clips , which is_(UnrelEv) a chain that has_(UnrelEv) a location near where I live_(UnrelEv) .
 They do not require_(RelNScrEv) an appointment , although you can check-in_(ScrEv_check_in) online ahead of time , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to walk_(RelNScrEv) in .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the location and found_(UnrelEv) a parking place easily , and there was_(UnrelEv) only one or two other customers there at the time .
 I walked_(ScrEv_enter) in and gave_(ScrEv_check_in) my name , and they had_(RelNScrEv) a record of what I had done_(RelNScrEv) at my previous visits .
 The woman who took_(ScrEv_check_in) my name and I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her that I wanted_(UnrelEv) a shampoo and a hair cut .
 She said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) that she could start_(UnrelEv) right away and led_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me to a section where I could leave_(UnrelEv) my phone and wallet .
 I put_(UnrelEv) those down , and followed_(RelNScrEv) her over to the chair for the shampoo .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very relaxing and did not take_(RelNScrEv) much time .
 We then went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) back to her section and she asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) what I wanted_(RelNScrEv) done_(RelNScrEv) .
 I explained_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) I just wanted_(RelNScrEv) about an inch taken_(ScrEv_cut) off of most of my hair , but my bangs to be cut_(ScrEv_cut) so they were_(UnrelEv) more above my eyes again .
 We did n't really talk_(ScrEv_small_talk) much while she was cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , and it took_(RelNScrEv) her less than ten minutes .
 I did not want_(UnrelEv) my hair blow dried_(ScrEv_dry) , so she left_(RelNScrEv) it wet .
 I went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) back to the front of the shop with her to pay_(ScrEv_pay) , and I also made_(UnrelEv) sure to leave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a tip .
 I left_(ScrEv_leave) the shop and was very pleased_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) with my hair cut .

 My hair was getting_(UnrelEv) long and it was getting_(UnrelEv) hard to style_(RelNScrEv) it .
 It looked_(UnrelEv) like it was_(UnrelEv) time to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .
 I called_(ScrEv_make_appointment) the hair salon to see if I could get_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment with my favorite hairdresser .
 She told_(RelNScrEv) me she could see_(UnrelEv) me that afternoon at 3pm .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the salon , parked_(UnrelEv) my car and went_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) .
 I sat_(ScrEv_wait) down_(ScrEv_wait) on one of the chairs in the waiting area .
 There were_(UnrelEv) several other people waiting_(ScrEv_wait) to see_(UnrelEv) their hairdresser .
 There was_(UnrelEv) an assortment of magazines on a table in the center of the waiting area .
 My hairdresser was still working_(UnrelEv) on another client , so I picked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) a magazine to read_(RelNScrEv) while I waited_(ScrEv_wait) my turn .
 When she was_(UnrelEv) ready for me I walked_(UnrelEv) over to her station and sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down_(ScrEv_sit_down) .
 The chair was operated_(UnrelEv) by hydraulics , and she adjusted_(RelNScrEv) the height so she could reach_(UnrelEv) my head easily .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a large mirror in front of the chair , and a small shelf that held_(UnrelEv) combs , brushes , and other tools .
 She placed_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a white tissue around my neck and then a black plastic cape which covered_(UnrelEv) my shoulders , back and front .
 She then squirted_(RelNScrEv) a liquid from a spray bottle over my hair to wet_(RelNScrEv) it and combed_(ScrEv_comb) it through .
 Although she has been cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair for quite a while , she asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) how I would like_(UnrelEv) my hair cut_(Evoking) since I might have decided_(UnrelEv) to change_(UnrelEv) the style .
 When I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her what I wanted_(UnrelEv) she began_(UnrelEv) to hold_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) sections of my hair in her fingers , using_(UnrelEv) a small scissors to cut_(ScrEv_cut) each piece .
 When my entire head of hair was cut_(ScrEv_cut) , she took_(RelNScrEv) a blow dryer and brush and dried_(ScrEv_dry) and styled_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) my hair .
 When she was_(UnrelEv) finished she gave_(RelNScrEv) me a small hand mirror and turned_(RelNScrEv) my chair around so I could see_(ScrEv_look_mirror) the back of my hair in the reflection of the large mirror .
 I was_(UnrelEv) happy with the way it came_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) and told_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) her so .
 She then removed_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the cape and tissue and we went_(UnrelEv) to the front of the salon where I paid_(ScrEv_pay) her for the cost of the haircut .
 She put_(UnrelEv) the money in a cash register and I gave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her some extra money as a tip , since I was_(UnrelEv) so pleased_(UnrelEv) with how my hair looked_(UnrelEv) .

 The last time I got_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) a very long time ago .
 I needed to look_(UnrelEv) presentable to see_(UnrelEv) my distant family .
 I called_(ScrEv_make_appointment) up_(ScrEv_make_appointment) and made_(ScrEv_make_appointment) a reservation with the salon for four twenty five in the afternoon the next day .
 The next day I went_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) and they asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me about what sort of haircut I wanted_(UnrelEv) .
 I did not really know_(UnrelEv) exactly what I wanted_(UnrelEv) so I let them just give_(ScrEv_cut) me a simple , regular haircut .
 They started_(UnrelEv) by washing_(ScrEv_wash) my hair by dipping_(RelNScrEv) my head into a sink , massaging_(RelNScrEv) the soap in , and finally washing_(RelNScrEv) it out .
 Next they dried_(ScrEv_dry) my hair a little bit , but left_(UnrelEv) it damp so it would be_(UnrelEv) easier for them to cut_(ScrEv_cut) .
 Then they started cutting_(ScrEv_cut) away using_(UnrelEv) a combination of scissors and a razor .
 After about thirty minutes they asked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) me how I felt_(UnrelEv) about my haircut , and since I approved_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) , the cut was_(UnrelEv) done .

 Upon entering_(ScrEv_enter) my local hair salon , I was greeted_(ScrEv_small_talk) by a stylist .
 She took_(ScrEv_check_in) my name and told_(UnrelEv) me that I would be_(UnrelEv) next to receive_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) , because no other customers were_(UnrelEv) in line before me .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) in a chair for several minutes , then she called_(ScrEv_get_called) my name and led_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me to the chair in which I would get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 The stylist introduced_(ScrEv_small_talk) herself and asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) how I would like_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) my hair cut_(ScrEv_cut) .
 I described_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) how I would like_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) my hair cut_(ScrEv_cut) and she showed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) that she understood_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) .
 Then , the stylist covered_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) me with a cape to keep_(UnrelEv) hair from getting_(RelNScrEv) on my clothes .
 She then sprayed_(RelNScrEv) my hair with water to wet_(RelNScrEv) it and quickly combed_(ScrEv_comb) my hair , preparing_(RelNScrEv) it to be cut_(ScrEv_cut) .
 Now we were_(UnrelEv) ready to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 With scissors , she cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair in sections , starting_(UnrelEv) at the front and working_(UnrelEv) toward the back .
 She used_(UnrelEv) her skills to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair to match_(RelNScrEv) what I described_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) to her earlier .
 Once she was finished_(UnrelEv) , she used_(UnrelEv) electric clippers to shave_(ScrEv_cut) my neckline and shape_(ScrEv_cut) the back of my hair .
 Once the haircut was_(UnrelEv) complete , she used_(UnrelEv) a blow drier to remove_(ScrEv_brush_hair) the cut_(ScrEv_cut) hair and then removed_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the cape .
 Finally , she led_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me to the cash register , where I paid_(ScrEv_pay) her for her services and thanked_(ScrEv_small_talk) her for her time .
 I then exited_(ScrEv_leave) the shop with a fresh haircut .

 I was looking_(UnrelEv) in the mirror this morning and noticed_(UnrelEv) my hair had gotten_(RelNScrEv) out of control .
 So I decided_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 I was_(UnrelEv) new to the area , so first I wanted to research_(RelNScrEv) all the available barber shops nearby .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) three different places , and all with great reviews .
 So I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_get_salon) the closest one to my house .
 When I got_(ScrEv_get_salon) there , I had to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for the 4 people currently waiting_(ScrEv_wait) before I arrived_(ScrEv_enter) .
 I started_(UnrelEv) looking_(RelNScrEv) at the posters on the wall and came_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) with some new ideas on what hair cut style I think_(UnrelEv) would look_(RelNScrEv) best on me .
 I decided_(RelNScrEv) on a buzz cut .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) my turn I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) the barber I wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) a buzz cut .
 He trimmed_(ScrEv_cut) my hair low , then got_(RelNScrEv) a fine-edge razor to get_(ScrEv_cut) my hairline .
 I walked_(ScrEv_leave) out_(ScrEv_leave) the barber shop feeling_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) like a new man .

 As I got_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) of the shower and looked_(UnrelEv) in the mirror today I realized_(UnrelEv) that my hair was getting_(RelNScrEv) quite shaggy and long .
 I think_(UnrelEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) time for a brand new hair cut !
 I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) down_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the barber shop and just as I should of known_(UnrelEv) , coming_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) on a Saturday was_(UnrelEv) not one of my most brightest ideas in hindsight .
 There was_(RelNScrEv) quite a crowd , but I figured_(UnrelEv) I was_(RelNScrEv) already here so I might as well just wait_(ScrEv_wait) .
 I went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) over_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) and put_(ScrEv_check_in) my name down under my barber , Bill , who has been cutting_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) for the past 10 years .
 As I waited_(ScrEv_wait) I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) a Sports Illustrated and sat_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) and began_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) how the Pirates were doing_(UnrelEv) in the World Series .
 After about 20 minutes or so Bill called_(ScrEv_get_called) my name up and asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what kind of hair cut I wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) him to stick_(RelNScrEv) with the usual and he put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) the big barber apron around me and began_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair while we talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) about life and caught_(ScrEv_small_talk) up_(ScrEv_small_talk) on what has been going_(UnrelEv) on_(UnrelEv) since the last time I saw_(UnrelEv) him , which was_(UnrelEv) about a month ago .
 Afterwards my haircut was done_(RelNScrEv) and I looked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) great !
 We went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) up_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) to the register and I paid_(ScrEv_pay) him and gave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) him a good tip , then was_(ScrEv_leave) on my way .

 It had_(UnrelEv) been a while since I got_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 My ends were_(UnrelEv) fried , frizzy , and dry .
 I did n't want to do_(UnrelEv) it .
 I did n't want to spend_(UnrelEv) the money , but I succumbed_(UnrelEv) and walked_(ScrEv_enter) into the salon .
 I had n't made_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment and therefore was told_(RelNScrEv) they could fit_(UnrelEv) me in a half an hour from now .
 I nodded_(UnrelEv) to wait_(ScrEv_wait) and took_(ScrEv_wait) a seat .
 I flipped_(RelNScrEv) through the magazines for hair inspirations and looked_(RelNScrEv) at my phone .
 When the time had passed_(UnrelEv) , the stylist called_(RelNScrEv) my name .
 She sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) me down and asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what I would like_(UnrelEv) .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her to cut_(ScrEv_cut) off_(ScrEv_cut) the damaged parts , but nothing fancy .
 She took_(UnrelEv) me over to the sinks to wash_(ScrEv_wash) my hair .
 After washing_(ScrEv_wash) and conditioning_(ScrEv_wash) it , she guided_(UnrelEv) me back over to the chair and draped_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a cloak over me .
 She combed_(ScrEv_comb) out my long hair and began snipping_(ScrEv_cut) .
 After she was_(UnrelEv) done , she blew_(ScrEv_dry) dry_(ScrEv_dry) the front part of my hair .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) at the register and walked_(UnrelEv) over_(UnrelEv) to give_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a $ 5 tip to thank_(RelNScrEv) her .
 My head felt_(UnrelEv) lighter and I was_(UnrelEv) happy with how it looked_(UnrelEv) .

 Last Saturday , I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) at my favorite hair salon .
 I walked_(ScrEv_enter) into the salon , told_(ScrEv_check_in) the girl at the desk why I was_(UnrelEv) there , and sat_(ScrEv_other) down in one of their comfy chairs to wait_(ScrEv_wait) .
 I browsed_(RelNScrEv) through magazines while I waited_(ScrEv_wait) .
 My hair stylist walked_(RelNScrEv) up and told_(UnrelEv) me she was_(UnrelEv) ready .
 She took_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me to her chair , I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down and we talked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) about what I wanted_(UnrelEv) done_(UnrelEv) that day .
 Then she walked_(ScrEv_prepare_wash) me over to the hair washing_(ScrEv_wash) station .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down and leaned_(RelNScrEv) my head back and she washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair with warm water and really nice smelling_(RelNScrEv) shampoo .
 When she was done_(UnrelEv) , she towel dried_(ScrEv_dry) my hair and we walked_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) back to her station .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down , she put_(ScrEv_put_towel) a cape around me to catch_(RelNScrEv) the hair she cuts_(ScrEv_cut) .
 And she began_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 When she finished_(UnrelEv) she blew_(ScrEv_dry) it dry and asked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) me how I liked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) it .
 I loved_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) it .
 So we walked_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) over to the desk , I paid_(ScrEv_pay) my bill , left_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a tip , and left_(ScrEv_leave) the salon .

 Getting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) can be_(UnrelEv) a stressful activity .
 You have to know_(UnrelEv) where you are going to go_(ScrEv_get_salon) for this service and how much you want_(UnrelEv) to spend_(ScrEv_pay) .
 Some people have_(UnrelEv) one hair dresser they like_(UnrelEv) and stick_(UnrelEv) with that person over years .
 I have n't had_(UnrelEv) such luck , so I sometime have to take_(UnrelEv) a gamble and just make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment at a random salon .
 If I want_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) a new look , I 'll make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to be prepared_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) with an example picture of exactly what I want_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) , or if I just want_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) a trim I coach_(RelNScrEv) myself into being_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) very firm about not cutting_(ScrEv_cut) too much .
 I try_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_salon) to my appointment early , in case they 're_(RelNScrEv) ready to see_(ScrEv_get_called) me sooner than they expected_(UnrelEv) .
 There is_(ScrEv_small_talk) generally small talk back and forth during the process , which can be_(UnrelEv) uncomfortable for socially awkard folks like myself , but I muddle_(ScrEv_small_talk) through_(ScrEv_small_talk) it somehow .
 If I am_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) happy with my service and with how my hair looks_(ScrEv_look_mirror) , I make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to leave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) a generous tip .

 I always wear_(RelNScrEv) my hair very long , but it needed trimmed_(ScrEv_cut) because I had_(RelNScrEv) some split_(RelNScrEv) ends .

 Then the magic happens_(UnrelEv) .
 He turns_(RelNScrEv) you away from the mirror and starts_(UnrelEv) clipping_(ScrEv_cut) away_(ScrEv_cut) , the whole time talking_(ScrEv_small_talk) with you about the weather and sports .
 He asks_(ScrEv_small_talk) about your family , and whether the fish are biting_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) at the local lake .
 In what seems_(UnrelEv) just like seconds , Lou takes_(ScrEv_cut) one last clip and spins_(RelNScrEv) you back to the mirror to show_(ScrEv_look_mirror) you his creation on your head .
 When you are satisfied_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) , you pay_(ScrEv_pay) him plus a little extra for the sheer perfection of this haircut , and tell_(ScrEv_make_appointment) him you will see_(RelNScrEv) him next month .

 I was looking_(UnrelEv) in the mirror two weeks ago and thought_(UnrelEv) my hair was getting_(UnrelEv) too long , it looked_(UnrelEv) scruffy and was getting_(UnrelEv) difficult to style_(UnrelEv) .
 I called_(ScrEv_make_appointment) my hairdresser and made_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment to go_(UnrelEv) and see_(UnrelEv) her the following week to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) difficult getting_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment because she was_(UnrelEv) very busy but I managed_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_make_appointment) one .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the hair salon where she works_(UnrelEv) and parked_(UnrelEv) the car .
 I walked_(ScrEv_enter) inside and spoke_(ScrEv_check_in) to the lady on the reception desk to tell_(UnrelEv) her who I was_(UnrelEv) and who I was_(UnrelEv) there to see_(UnrelEv) , and she asked_(RelNScrEv) me to take_(ScrEv_wait) a seat in the waiting area .
 There were_(UnrelEv) lots of hair products on shelves around where I was sitting_(ScrEv_wait) , and some hair style magazines on a table in front of the sofa I was sitting_(ScrEv_wait) on .
 My stylist came_(UnrelEv) through a door and greeted_(RelNScrEv) me and took_(UnrelEv) me past people sitting_(UnrelEv) on chairs in front of mirrors , all of them in various stages of having_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down_(ScrEv_sit_down) at my stylist 's usual chair and faced_(UnrelEv) the mirror while she asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what I wanted_(UnrelEv) her to do_(UnrelEv) .
 Sometimes when I go_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) her I will have_(UnrelEv) a picture of a style that I like_(UnrelEv) that I have found_(UnrelEv) on the internet or in a magazine but this time I just wanted_(UnrelEv) her to keep_(UnrelEv) it the same style but make_(UnrelEv) it shorter .
 First of all she took_(UnrelEv) me to an area with basins for washing_(ScrEv_wash) hair and I had to sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) with my back to it , with my head tilted_(UnrelEv) back so my hair was_(UnrelEv) in the basin .
 My stylist rolled_(ScrEv_prepare_wash) up_(ScrEv_prepare_wash) a towel and put_(ScrEv_prepare_wash) it under the back of my neck to make_(UnrelEv) the position more comfortable and washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair for me .
 After she was_(UnrelEv) done she took_(UnrelEv) me back to the chair and started_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , she pinned_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) sections of hair that she was n't working_(UnrelEv) on and gradually let_(UnrelEv) them down to cut_(ScrEv_cut) them , eventually she had done_(UnrelEv) all of it .
 She plugged_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) the hairdryer and sprayed_(RelNScrEv) some lotion onto my hair to make_(UnrelEv) it easier to blow_(ScrEv_dry) dry_(ScrEv_dry) and proceeded_(UnrelEv) to dry_(ScrEv_dry) my hair until it was_(UnrelEv) all dry and styled_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) and shorter .
 When she was_(UnrelEv) finished she held_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) a mirror for me so I could see_(ScrEv_look_mirror) the back of my hair .
 I was_(UnrelEv) happy with it so I said_(RelNScrEv) goodbye and walked_(UnrelEv) back to the lady on the reception desk to pay_(ScrEv_pay) her for the hair cut .

 It all began_(UnrelEv) when I woke_(UnrelEv) up in the morning and noticed_(UnrelEv) the messiest hair I had ever seen_(UnrelEv) in my entire life .
 I looked_(UnrelEv) like a porcupine with its burrs all sticking_(UnrelEv) straight out in every direction .
 There was_(UnrelEv) no way I was going to be seen_(UnrelEv) in public like this .
 I hurried_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) ready and wet_(UnrelEv) my head completely to make it seem_(UnrelEv) like it was_(UnrelEv) a normal hairdo .
 I quickly went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the barber shop to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) complete_(Evoking) buzz_(Evoking) so that I will never have to see_(UnrelEv) that ugly porcupine hair ever again .
 The barber quickly buzzes_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) my hair and then blends_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it together so that it looks_(RelNScrEv) normal .
 We talk_(ScrEv_small_talk) during the appointment about my life and how my school is .
 She is_(UnrelEv) a very nice lady and we get_(UnrelEv) along quite well .
 The haircut only costs_(RelNScrEv) $ 15 but I pay_(ScrEv_pay) with a $ 20 and let_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her keep_(UnrelEv) the change .
 I believe_(UnrelEv) everyone who does_(RelNScrEv) a good job deserves_(UnrelEv) a tip !

 My previous haircut was done_(UnrelEv) very poorly at what I thought_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) a decent place .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) other nearby barbers by doing_(RelNScrEv) a google search for them in my zip code .
 I ended up choosing_(RelNScrEv) one place I used_(UnrelEv) to frequent_(UnrelEv) in the past and knew_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) reliable .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_salon) over to the barber and entered_(ScrEv_enter) the store .
 It was_(UnrelEv) during a non-busy hour so when I entered_(ScrEv_enter) they immediately asked_(RelNScrEv) me to come_(ScrEv_check_in) to the account register .
 I gave_(ScrEv_check_in) them some basic info about me and was sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down_(ScrEv_sit_down) in a chair .

 Next , I moved_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) over to a special , big chair and he wrapped_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a smock around me so that the cut_(ScrEv_cut) hair would n't get_(RelNScrEv) on my clothes . ''
 `` Just a trim , '' '' I told him .
 He pushed_(RelNScrEv) a foot pedal at the bottom of the chair and I was raised_(RelNScrEv) upwards so that he could see_(UnrelEv) more clearly .
 He began_(UnrelEv) snipping_(ScrEv_cut) at my hair with his scissors , and I watched_(ScrEv_look_mirror) him in the mirror .
 After some time , he put_(RelNScrEv) the scissors away and began_(UnrelEv) combing_(ScrEv_comb) my hair .
 It was_(UnrelEv) all done_(UnrelEv) !
 He brushed_(ScrEv_brush_hair) the loose hairs off my neck and unhooked_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the smock .
 The parts of my hair he had cut_(ScrEv_cut) away were_(UnrelEv) all over the floor .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) him and went_(UnrelEv) home with my clean , shorter hair .

 I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) stylist_(Evoking) for a trim .
 While I was seated_(ScrEv_wait) in the waiting area , I happened_(UnrelEv) to glance_(UnrelEv) a cover of a hair styling book and , being intrigued_(UnrelEv) , decided_(UnrelEv) to pick_(RelNScrEv) it up and browse_(RelNScrEv) .
 I found_(UnrelEv) a haircut I really liked_(UnrelEv) .
 My hairstylist called_(ScrEv_get_called) my name and led_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me back to her barber chair .
 She wrapped_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a drape around my shoulders to protect_(RelNScrEv) my clothes from hair clippings , asking_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what I was looking_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) with my hair this time .
 I pointed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) out the book I had been looking_(UnrelEv) through and showed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her the picture I had found_(UnrelEv) .
 She nodded_(UnrelEv) , spritzed_(ScrEv_other) water on my head with her spray bottle , then grabbed_(RelNScrEv) her comb and started running_(ScrEv_comb) it through my hair .
 She then grabbed_(RelNScrEv) her scissors and started_(UnrelEv) trimming_(ScrEv_cut) the length , parted_(RelNScrEv) some hair to one side and clipped_(ScrEv_cut) that side .
 Then she parted_(RelNScrEv) and clipped_(ScrEv_cut) the other to match , all the while chatting_(ScrEv_small_talk) with me about stuff .
 A few moments later , she applied_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) a little hair gel and worked_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it through my hair .
 Pleased_(RelNScrEv) with the outcome , she spun_(UnrelEv) me around so I could see_(ScrEv_look_mirror) the mirror and asked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) how I liked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) my new hairdo .
 I loved_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) it so much that I gave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a nice tip when I paid_(ScrEv_pay) the bill !

 Yesterday , I went_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) a_(RelNScrEv) haircut_(RelNScrEv) .
 When I walked_(ScrEv_enter) into the salon , a lady named_(UnrelEv) Sara came_(UnrelEv) over_(UnrelEv) and told_(RelNScrEv) me to follow_(UnrelEv) her to the shampoo station .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) in a chair and another lady named_(UnrelEv) Marsha washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair and put_(ScrEv_put_towel) a towel around my head .
 She then took_(UnrelEv) me over to Sara who asked_(UnrelEv) me to sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) in her chair and put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a cape around my neck .
 Next Sara asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me how short I wanted_(UnrelEv) my hair .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her I still wanted_(UnrelEv) it to be_(UnrelEv) a little past my shoulders , therefore , she should only cut_(ScrEv_cut) off about 1 inch .
 She told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me that was_(UnrelEv) fine and began cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 It took_(UnrelEv) her about twenty minutes to cut_(ScrEv_cut) an inch off of all of my hair .
 After she cut_(ScrEv_cut) it , she took_(RelNScrEv) the blow dryer out and dried_(ScrEv_dry) my hair .
 Then she curled_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it with a curling iron .
 It looked_(UnrelEv) really great !
 So I paid_(ScrEv_pay) her for cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair and told_(RelNScrEv) her how much I appreciated_(UnrelEv) the great job that she did_(UnrelEv) for me !

 I have_(RelNScrEv) really long hair so I tend_(UnrelEv) to trim_(ScrEv_cut) my hair myself .
 If I need to go_(RelNScrEv) in to get it done_(Unclear) , it 's_(UnrelEv) because I need_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) really_(Evoking) good_(Evoking) trim_(Evoking) .
 My hair goes_(RelNScrEv) all the way down almost to my butt , so I am_(UnrelEv) very leery of letting_(UnrelEv) other people mess_(RelNScrEv) with my hair .
 I will sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) there and listen_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) to them say_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) how much they think_(UnrelEv) needs_(UnrelEv) to be trimmed_(ScrEv_cut) and then tell_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) them how much I want trimmed_(ScrEv_cut) and it ends_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) somewhere in between .
 It is really annoying_(UnrelEv) when you have_(RelNScrEv) long hair and want_(UnrelEv) to keep_(RelNScrEv) it that way and the girl who chops_(ScrEv_cut) it off just does n't understand_(UnrelEv) some people happen_(UnrelEv) to like having_(RelNScrEv) it really long .
 So , I usually avoid_(UnrelEv) going_(ScrEv_get_salon) and getting_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) , and just trim_(ScrEv_cut) it myself .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) easy , I know_(UnrelEv) what I want_(UnrelEv) , I wo n't chop_(ScrEv_cut) it all off , and if I screw_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) I have_(UnrelEv) no one to blame_(UnrelEv) but myself .

 I called_(UnrelEv) my salon and made an appointment for Monday .
 My salon is_(UnrelEv) one of several stores in the Chicago area .
 It is_(UnrelEv) located in a busy shopping area and has_(UnrelEv) a modern and edgy feel .
 Before going_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the salon , I found_(UnrelEv) a couple pictures online of haircuts that I liked_(UnrelEv) .

 I drove_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the salon and went_(ScrEv_enter) inside .

 We talked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) about the type of haircut I wanted_(UnrelEv) , and I showed_(RelNScrEv) her the pictures on my phone .

 Yesterday , I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 I made_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment with my hairstylist a week prior .
 I was tired_(UnrelEv) of my long hair so I decided_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) time for a new hair look .
 Even though , I wanted_(UnrelEv) a new hair style , I was_(UnrelEv) still very nervous .
 Cutting_(ScrEv_cut) hair is_(UnrelEv) a very big change .
 Before she cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , she washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair .
 After she washed_(ScrEv_wash) it , she did n't do_(UnrelEv) a_(UnrelEv) big chop .
 She cut_(ScrEv_cut) little by little so I wo n't be_(UnrelEv) in utter shock .
 Every time she cut_(ScrEv_cut) it , I took_(UnrelEv) a deep breath and accepted_(RelNScrEv) it .
 After all , hair does grow_(UnrelEv) back eventually .
 Eventually she managed_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) it at the specific length I wanted_(RelNScrEv) it .
 Afterwards , she layered_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it and styled_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it properly .
 At this point , she did n't let_(UnrelEv) me see_(ScrEv_look_mirror) the final result until she was finished_(RelNScrEv) .
 When she was done_(RelNScrEv) , she turned_(ScrEv_look_mirror) me over to the mirror and I was shocked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) .
 It was_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) beautiful .
 I loved_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) my new hair cut !

 It is_(UnrelEv) important to have_(UnrelEv) hair that is_(UnrelEv) clean , groomed_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) and presentable .
 One key component to good hair is_(UnrelEv) getting_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 The way I like it cut_(ScrEv_cut) is best done_(UnrelEv) within the confines of a beauty school .
 To set_(ScrEv_make_appointment) up_(ScrEv_make_appointment) a cut at the beauty school which I like to go_(ScrEv_get_salon) to , I call_(ScrEv_make_appointment) in a day or two before to set_(ScrEv_make_appointment) up_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment .
 At the appropriate appointment time I make_(ScrEv_get_salon) my way to the school and check_(ScrEv_check_in) in_(ScrEv_check_in) .
 A friendly student always greets_(ScrEv_small_talk) me and steers_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me to her station .
 I explain_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) to him or her thoroughly what I like done_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) to my hair .
 It helps_(UnrelEv) that I always bring_(RelNScrEv) photos in to show_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) what I would like_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) it cut_(ScrEv_cut) like .
 As they cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair I always chat_(ScrEv_small_talk) with them .
 I like getting_(UnrelEv) to know_(UnrelEv) people and this is_(UnrelEv) always enjoyable for me and for my stylist .
 At the end of the cut , they brush_(ScrEv_brush_hair) off_(ScrEv_brush_hair) all the hair and ask_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) how I like_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) it .
 I always give_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) glowing_(UnrelEv) praise .
 I pay_(ScrEv_pay) for the cut and am_(ScrEv_leave) on my way .

 Every two months or so I go_(ScrEv_get_salon) and get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) trimmed_(Evoking) .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) always the same thing .
 I wash_(ScrEv_wash) it before I leave_(UnrelEv) the house , which is_(UnrelEv) funny because I also pay_(ScrEv_pay) to have_(UnrelEv) it washed_(ScrEv_wash) at the salon .
 I just do n't want_(UnrelEv) to show_(UnrelEv) up with dirty_(UnrelEv) hair !
 Once there , my regular girl Betty takes_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me back and washes_(ScrEv_wash) it , then directs_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) me to her station where I sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) in a raised_(UnrelEv) chair .
 She snips_(ScrEv_cut) and buzzes_(ScrEv_cut) and cuts_(ScrEv_cut) quickly , she knows_(RelNScrEv) exactly how I like_(UnrelEv) my hair cut_(RelNScrEv) .
 While she does_(ScrEv_cut) all that , I 'm huddled_(UnrelEv) under a protective cape , and I like_(UnrelEv) to just chat_(ScrEv_small_talk) with her about everything that comes_(UnrelEv) to mind .
 We gossip_(ScrEv_small_talk) about the local people , I share_(ScrEv_small_talk) my upcoming_(UnrelEv) travels , she fills_(ScrEv_small_talk) me in on her kid 's latest happenings_(UnrelEv) .
 Then before I know_(UnrelEv) it , I 'm all trimmed_(ScrEv_cut) up and she 's got_(RelNScrEv) the hair dryer and round brush out making_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it look_(UnrelEv) beautiful .
 I can_(UnrelEv) never copy_(UnrelEv) what she does_(RelNScrEv) at home , so I just let_(UnrelEv) myself enjoy_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) it while I can_(UnrelEv) !
 After that I pay_(ScrEv_pay) , and always come_(UnrelEv) back to slip_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a cash tip and tell_(UnrelEv) her I 'll see_(UnrelEv) her in two months .

 Once they called_(RelNScrEv) my name I went_(UnrelEv) and sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) at the chair and the barber put_(ScrEv_other) a towel over me so that the hair that he cuts_(ScrEv_cut) does n't get_(UnrelEv) over my clothes .
 I tell_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) him what kind of haircut I want_(UnrelEv) and then he begins_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 He periodically asks_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) me if he is doing_(UnrelEv) a good job throughout the haircut to make sure that I am_(UnrelEv) happy with the hair that he is cutting_(ScrEv_cut) .
 I reassure_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) him that he is doing_(UnrelEv) a good job and after he is_(UnrelEv) done he takes_(ScrEv_remove_cap) off_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the towel and I get_(ScrEv_look_mirror) a final look at my haircut .

 My stylist comes_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) over and asks_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me how I would like my haircut as we walk_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) over to their station .
 I consider_(UnrelEv) getting_(RelNScrEv) new style and we look_(ScrEv_other) over a few books that have_(UnrelEv) photographs inside .
 I decide_(UnrelEv) just to keep_(UnrelEv) my original style and the stylist takes_(ScrEv_other) me over to the wash station and washes_(ScrEv_wash) and conditions_(ScrEv_wash) my hair .
 I go_(ScrEv_other) back to the chair where the stylist is stationed_(UnrelEv) and she begins_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 It takes_(RelNScrEv) about 20 minutes for her to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair and style_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) and blow-dry_(ScrEv_dry) my hair , but when she finishes_(RelNScrEv) I am_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) very pleased with the way my hair looks_(UnrelEv) .

 I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to my hairdresser a few weeks ago for a hair cut .
 My appointment was_(RelNScrEv) at 3:15 , so I arrived_(ScrEv_enter) at about 3:10 .
 When I got_(ScrEv_enter) there , Kayla -LRB- my hairdresser -RRB- was still finishing_(RelNScrEv) up with her last appointment .
 So I sat_(ScrEv_wait) in the waiting area .
 The attendant at the desk offered_(ScrEv_wait) me water or coffee , but I said_(UnrelEv) no thank_(UnrelEv) you .
 When Kayla was done_(RelNScrEv) with her last appointment , she called_(ScrEv_get_called) me in and I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down in the swivel chair in front of the mirror at her station .
 She asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) what I wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) done_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) with my hair , and I showed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her about how short I wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) it to be_(UnrelEv) , a little shorter than usual .
 She noticed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) that my hair did seem_(UnrelEv) to have grown_(RelNScrEv) a lot since the last time I was_(RelNScrEv) in .
 We went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) to a back room where there are_(UnrelEv) sinks for washing_(ScrEv_wash) hair .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down in front of the sink Kayla told_(UnrelEv) me to sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) at , then I leaned_(UnrelEv) back to put_(ScrEv_prepare_wash) my head in the sink , and Kayla washed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair and conditioned_(ScrEv_wash) it .
 Then she put_(ScrEv_put_towel) a towel on my hair and we went_(ScrEv_sit_down) back to her chair , where she cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 While she was cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , we talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) about a lot of things .
 Kayla has_(UnrelEv) a young son so I asked_(ScrEv_small_talk) about him .
 I also ended_(UnrelEv) up talking_(ScrEv_small_talk) to a woman who was getting_(Evoking) her_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) next to me .
 The time flew_(UnrelEv) , and then Kayla used_(ScrEv_dry) the blow dryer to dry_(ScrEv_dry) my hair and curled_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it with a flat iron and put_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) hair spray on it .
 I was_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) very happy with my hair cut .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) at the front desk and made_(UnrelEv) sure to leave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) Kayla a tip , and then I went_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 I needed to get_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 There is_(UnrelEv) a place nearby where they cut_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) relatively inexpensive , but nothing fancy .
 You do n't need_(UnrelEv) an appointment .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) there , walked_(ScrEv_enter) in_(ScrEv_enter) , and told_(ScrEv_check_in) the woman at the desk my name .
 She told_(RelNScrEv) me they 'd be_(UnrelEv) ready for me in a few minutes .
 I sat_(ScrEv_wait) down_(ScrEv_wait) in one of the chairs in the lobby and looked_(UnrelEv) around_(UnrelEv) at the pictures on the walls .
 All of them are_(UnrelEv) pictures of men and women showing stylish haircuts .
 In a few minutes they called_(RelNScrEv) my name and I walked_(UnrelEv) to the rear of the place , where they cut_(ScrEv_cut) your hair .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) in the chair and the woman cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a big sheet over me to keep_(UnrelEv) the hair off me as she cut_(ScrEv_cut) .
 She asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what I wanted done_(UnrelEv) and raised_(RelNScrEv) my chair so it was_(UnrelEv) a convenient level for her .

 Last week , I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) Supercuts_(Evoking) for_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .
 There were_(UnrelEv) only two people in the waiting area , so I assumed_(UnrelEv) that I would n't have to wait_(ScrEv_wait) long .
 However , Supercuts has_(UnrelEv) an option where you can phone_(RelNScrEv) in ahead of your arrival and get_(ScrEv_other) on the waiting list and apparently several people had done_(UnrelEv) this .
 After about an hour and a half , I was called_(ScrEv_other) back .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) in a chair and the girl asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me how I wanted_(RelNScrEv) my hair cut_(ScrEv_cut) .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her that I wanted_(RelNScrEv) it cut_(ScrEv_cut) behind my ears and about two inches off the length all over .
 She covered_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) me with a plastic sheet up to my neck , took_(RelNScrEv) a spray bottle and wet_(ScrEv_wash) my hair down , combed_(ScrEv_comb) it through , and began cutting_(ScrEv_cut) .
 She started_(UnrelEv) by trimming_(ScrEv_cut) around my ears so that they were exposed_(UnrelEv) .
 Next , she took_(RelNScrEv) her comb and grabbed_(RelNScrEv) a hand full of hair on the top of my head .
 She combed_(ScrEv_comb) it straight up with one hand while following_(ScrEv_comb) the comb with my hair between two fingers of her other hand , stopping_(UnrelEv) about two inches short of the ends .
 She took_(RelNScrEv) her scissors and snipped_(ScrEv_cut) the top two inches of my hair and then grabbed_(RelNScrEv) an adjacent handful of hair and repeated_(RelNScrEv) this action .
 She did_(UnrelEv) this until she had gone_(UnrelEv) over my entire head .
 During all of this , we chatted_(ScrEv_small_talk) about the weather , what kind of food we liked_(UnrelEv) , and some other trivial , but interesting things .
 Finally , she combed_(ScrEv_comb) my hair down into the style that I had_(UnrelEv) when I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down and asked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) me how it looked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) . ''
 `` Great ! '' ''
 , I replied_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) .
 She removed_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the plastic sheet and brushed_(ScrEv_brush_hair) me off and we headed_(RelNScrEv) to the cash register .
 She rang_(ScrEv_pay) me up on the register and I swiped_(ScrEv_pay) my credit card , leaving_(ScrEv_leave_tip) a tip in the process .
 We each told_(RelNScrEv) the other to '' `` Have_(UnrelEv) a good day '' '' and I headed_(ScrEv_leave) out the door .

 My hair grows_(RelNScrEv) so fast .
 The other day I noticed_(UnrelEv) it was getting_(RelNScrEv) a little wild .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) to myself , '' `` It is_(Evoking) time_(Evoking) for_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) ! '' ''
 I have heard_(UnrelEv) of a great salon in town called_(UnrelEv) Cuts-R-Us and thought_(UnrelEv) I would give_(UnrelEv) it a try .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the phone number , and I gave_(ScrEv_make_appointment) them a call .
 A girl named_(UnrelEv) Gina answered_(ScrEv_make_appointment) the phone and asked_(ScrEv_make_appointment) how she could help_(ScrEv_make_appointment) .
 I told_(ScrEv_make_appointment) her that I need_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment for a hair cut .
 We set_(ScrEv_make_appointment) the appointment for 2:00 the next day .
 This is_(UnrelEv) exciting to try_(RelNScrEv) a new salon !
 The next day rolled_(UnrelEv) around and I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to Cuts-R-Us at about 1:45 , it never hurts_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) a little early .
 Gina greeted_(ScrEv_small_talk) me and said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) that Shelly would be cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 Shelly was just finishing_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) with a client and cleaning_(ScrEv_other) her area .
 Shelly called_(RelNScrEv) me over and we discussed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) what style I would like_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) .
 I just wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) a trim with some layers .
 Shelly put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a cape around my neck and adjusted_(ScrEv_sit_down) my chair .
 She got_(RelNScrEv) a water bottle and sprayed_(RelNScrEv) my hair ; it is_(UnrelEv) easier to cut_(ScrEv_cut) wet hair .
 She then cut_(ScrEv_cut) , cut_(ScrEv_cut) , and cut_(ScrEv_cut) some more .
 It took_(UnrelEv) a long time .
 Shelly blow_(ScrEv_dry) dried_(ScrEv_dry) my hair and styled_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it for me .
 It looks_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) very nice now !
 She used_(RelNScrEv) a little brush to get_(RelNScrEv) small stray hairs off of my face , and then she removed_(ScrEv_remove_cap) my cape .
 I went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) up_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) to the cash register where Gina complemented_(RelNScrEv) my new cut .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) for my hair cut and left_(ScrEv_leave_tip) a little tip for Shelly .
 Sometimes , when someone does_(UnrelEv) a good job , I like_(UnrelEv) to give_(ScrEv_leave_tip) them a little extra to show_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) my appreciation .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_leave) home .
 I enjoyed_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) the services at Cuts-R-Us , and I love_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) my new cut !

 Last week , I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to one of my favorite hairstylists after trying_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment with her for over a month .
 She 's_(UnrelEv) very in demand and it is_(UnrelEv) hard to get_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment with her .
 After finally getting_(ScrEv_make_appointment) one , I was_(UnrelEv) very happy to be_(UnrelEv) able to see_(UnrelEv) her as my hair had gotten_(UnrelEv) a bit too long for my tastes .
 When I got_(ScrEv_get_salon) there , she started_(UnrelEv) with a very gentle shampooing_(ScrEv_wash) and scalp_(ScrEv_scalp_massage) massage_(ScrEv_scalp_massage) .
 She also gave_(UnrelEv) me a beer to have_(UnrelEv) while this was happening_(UnrelEv) .
 Afterwards she did_(UnrelEv) some aromatherapy and walked_(UnrelEv) me back over to her chair where she cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 She knows_(UnrelEv) me well as I go_(Unclear) to her fairly often when I feel_(UnrelEv) like spending_(UnrelEv) good money on a haircut , so it turned_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) great !
 Afterwards , I thanked_(RelNScrEv) her and made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to leave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a nice tip for her good work .
 Finally , I left_(ScrEv_leave) and went_(ScrEv_leave) home .

 As I was getting_(UnrelEv) ready for work this morning , I noticed_(UnrelEv) in the mirror that my hair was getting_(UnrelEv) a bit longer than I 'd like_(UnrelEv) .
 I resolved_(UnrelEv) to go get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) after work .
 While I was_(UnrelEv) at work , I researched_(RelNScrEv) salons .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) on one while I was_(UnrelEv) at lunch , and called_(ScrEv_make_appointment) to make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment for 5 pm .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_salon) there about 15 minutes early , and informed_(ScrEv_check_in) the receptionist that I had_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment .
 She welcomed_(ScrEv_check_in) me and asked_(ScrEv_check_in) me to have_(ScrEv_wait) a seat .
 I saw_(ScrEv_wait) and perused_(ScrEv_wait) a few magazines and hairstyle books while I waited_(ScrEv_wait) , and actually found_(RelNScrEv) a style I liked_(UnrelEv) more than what I had already had_(UnrelEv) in mind .
 Once the stylist was done_(RelNScrEv) with her previous client , she came_(RelNScrEv) to greet_(RelNScrEv) me .
 She asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) what I wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) and I presented_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) the picture I found_(RelNScrEv) .
 She said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) that was_(UnrelEv) no problem , and took_(ScrEv_sit_down) me back to the styling chair .
 She washed_(ScrEv_wash) and conditioned_(ScrEv_wash) my hair and put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a cape on me .
 She confirmed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) with me again what I wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) , and set_(UnrelEv) off to cutting_(ScrEv_cut) .
 I sat_(UnrelEv) as tiny bits of hair fell_(RelNScrEv) all around me .
 Once she was done_(RelNScrEv) , she blow dried_(ScrEv_dry) and styled_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) my hair .
 It looked_(UnrelEv) just like the picture .
 That 's how I got_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .

 First , I called_(ScrEv_make_appointment) ahead_(ScrEv_make_appointment) to the salon and asked_(ScrEv_make_appointment) for an appointment to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) they knew_(UnrelEv) I was coming_(ScrEv_get_salon) .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) them that I just wanted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) , no coloring_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) or curling_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) .
 I did n't want anything complicated_(UnrelEv) since that takes_(UnrelEv) more time .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) at_(RelNScrEv) the internet to find_(RelNScrEv) pictures of haircuts that I liked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) and printed_(RelNScrEv) them out .
 I arrived_(ScrEv_get_salon) at the salon about 10 minutes early and waited_(ScrEv_wait) patiently in the seating area .
 When it was_(RelNScrEv) my turn , I said_(ScrEv_small_talk) hello to the stylist and showed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her my pictures .
 I asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) if she could do_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) like that for me and if it would suit_(RelNScrEv) me .
 She said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) it would be_(UnrelEv) fine .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) down_(ScrEv_sit_down) in the chair .
 She showed_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me about where she wanted to cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , but I thought_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) it was_(RelNScrEv) too short .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her so politely and she adjusted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) the length until it was_(UnrelEv) just right for me .
 Then , she washed_(ScrEv_wash) and dried_(ScrEv_dry) my hair and checked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) the length with me again .
 Once I said_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) yes , she started_(UnrelEv) to cut_(ScrEv_cut) it .
 I liked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) how it was looking_(ScrEv_look_mirror) , so I did n't need to tell_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her to stop_(RelNScrEv) .
 She let_(UnrelEv) me look_(ScrEv_look_mirror) at myself in the mirror .
 I liked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) it .
 I thanked_(ScrEv_small_talk) her , paid_(ScrEv_pay) for her services , and left_(ScrEv_leave_tip) a tip .

 This weekend I went_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) down town to my favorite barber shop and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the barber to be done_(RelNScrEv) with his current client .
 I sat_(RelNScrEv) and read_(RelNScrEv) some magazines while I waited_(ScrEv_wait) .
 Then when it was_(UnrelEv) my turn .
 If I wanted_(UnrelEv) , I could choose_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) from a selection of hair cuts he had_(UnrelEv) on his walls , or I could ask_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) for something specific , but I just wanted_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) my usual .
 I had n't come_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) for_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) in a while , so I had_(UnrelEv) a lot of hair to remove_(ScrEv_cut) .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) in his barber chair , and he put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a cloth around my neck to keep_(RelNScrEv) the hair off of my clothes .
 He sprayed_(RelNScrEv) my hair with a little water to keep_(RelNScrEv) the loose hair together , and then he began_(UnrelEv) clipping_(ScrEv_cut) away_(ScrEv_cut) the larger amounts of hair with a pair of scissors .
 Then when my hair was_(RelNScrEv) shorter , he brought_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) some electric hair clippers and started_(UnrelEv) trimming_(ScrEv_cut) my hair to an even length .
 The clippers made_(RelNScrEv) a loud buzzing_(UnrelEv) noise in my ear , which used_(UnrelEv) to scare_(UnrelEv) me but now I think_(UnrelEv) is_(UnrelEv) kind of fun .
 Finally , he used_(RelNScrEv) the scissors again to trim_(ScrEv_cut) any stray hairs , and then wiped_(ScrEv_brush_hair) me off and took_(ScrEv_remove_cap) off_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the cloth .
 I paid_(ScrEv_pay) him , shook_(RelNScrEv) his hand and thanked_(ScrEv_small_talk) him , and left_(ScrEv_leave) the barber shop with my nice clean hair cut .

 I asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) the hairdresser to go_(UnrelEv) forward with what they thought_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) best .

 She told_(ScrEv_check_in) me it would be_(UnrelEv) a few minutes , so I went_(UnrelEv) to sit_(ScrEv_other) down .
 While I was waiting_(ScrEv_wait) , I thumbed_(RelNScrEv) through some of the magazines in the waiting area to get_(RelNScrEv) ideas of how I wanted_(UnrelEv) my hair cut_(RelNScrEv) .
 A few minutes later , the stylist called_(ScrEv_get_called) me back to sit_(ScrEv_sit_down) in her chair .
 We talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) about the weather while she washed and shampooed_(ScrEv_wash) my hair .
 She took_(UnrelEv) a comb and started_(UnrelEv) to comb_(ScrEv_comb) the tangles out of my hair .
 The shampoo made_(UnrelEv) my hair smell_(RelNScrEv) really nice , and I complemented_(RelNScrEv) her on the choice .
 She asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) what style of hair cut I wanted_(UnrelEv) .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her I had decided_(RelNScrEv) on a bob .
 She started_(UnrelEv) to go to work .
 She sectioned_(ScrEv_other) my hair off with clips and started_(UnrelEv) to trim_(ScrEv_cut) it with her scissors .
 I have to admit_(UnrelEv) that every time I get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) , I get_(UnrelEv) a little nervous .
 There is_(UnrelEv) always the chance of not being_(UnrelEv) happy with the end result , but my stylist reassured_(UnrelEv) me that she had_(UnrelEv) years of experience and she would ask_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) periodically if I thought_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) the length was getting_(RelNScrEv) to short .
 A few minutes later , we both agreed_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) that the length was_(UnrelEv) right .
 She finished_(ScrEv_cut) the cut , and I went_(ScrEv_dry) under the hair dryer for awhile .
 I read_(RelNScrEv) some more magazines , since I could n't hear_(UnrelEv) to talk_(UnrelEv) with anyone .
 When I was finished_(UnrelEv) I went_(ScrEv_move_in_salon) up front to the receptionist and paid_(ScrEv_pay) for my hair cut .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a nice , relaxing day .

 Last week I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) to the hairdresser and got_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) hair_(Evoking) cut_(Evoking) .
 When I got_(ScrEv_get_salon) there , the receptionist told_(ScrEv_check_in) me I could have_(ScrEv_wait) a seat and she 'd call_(RelNScrEv) me when it was_(UnrelEv) time for my appointment .
 I flipped_(RelNScrEv) through a magazine , and about five minutes later my name was called_(RelNScrEv) .
 A woman gave_(RelNScrEv) me an apron to put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) on_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) .
 The apron was_(UnrelEv) to keep_(UnrelEv) water and hair off my clothes during my appointment .
 She brought_(UnrelEv) me over to a sink and sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) me in front of it .
 The sink has_(UnrelEv) a special notch so you can lean_(RelNScrEv) your head back comfortably .
 She wet_(ScrEv_wash) my hair and shampooed_(ScrEv_wash) it , then brought_(UnrelEv) me to my stylist .
 I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) in a swivel chair in front of a mirror .
 The chair swivels_(UnrelEv) so the stylist can turn_(RelNScrEv) me and reach_(UnrelEv) different areas of my hair .
 She asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me how I 'd like_(UnrelEv) my hair cut .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her I 'd like_(UnrelEv) her to cut_(ScrEv_cut) a few inches off , and to give_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) my hair some layers to fluff_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) it up .
 She used_(UnrelEv) special extra sharp hair-cutting scissors and cut_(ScrEv_cut) my hair .
 Every so often , she - asked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) me how I liked_(UnrelEv) it so far .
 When she finished_(UnrelEv) , she gave_(RelNScrEv) a mirror to hold_(RelNScrEv) and turned_(RelNScrEv) the chair around .
 I was able to hold_(RelNScrEv) the mirror in front of my face , and at the same time , see_(ScrEv_look_mirror) the back of my head in the large mirror .
 I told_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) her I was_(UnrelEv) happy with the cut .
 She blew-dry_(ScrEv_dry) my hair , and added_(ScrEv_make_hair_style) some styling mousse .
 I gave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a tip , then I paid_(ScrEv_pay) for the haircut at the front desk .
 I almost forgot_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_remove_cap) off_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the apron before I left_(ScrEv_leave) .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) haircut_(Evoking) yesterday .
 A friend recommended_(UnrelEv) a place where I would n't have to make_(ScrEv_make_appointment) an appointment ahead of time , so I went_(ScrEv_get_salon) there .
 After I got_(ScrEv_get_salon) there , I took_(RelNScrEv) a ticket and waited_(ScrEv_wait) my turn .
 Then one of the beautician s called_(RelNScrEv) for me and I sat_(ScrEv_sit_down) in her chair .
 The first thing she did_(UnrelEv) was introduce_(RelNScrEv) herself and then she asked_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) me what kind of haircut I wanted_(UnrelEv) while she looked_(RelNScrEv) at my hair .
 I told_(ScrEv_talk_haircut) her just to give_(ScrEv_cut) me the same cut , only about an inch shorter .
 So , the next thing she did_(UnrelEv) was put_(ScrEv_put_on_cape) a plastic cape around my shoulders to protect_(UnrelEv) my clothes and then she turned_(RelNScrEv) me around and lowered_(RelNScrEv) my chair so she could wash_(ScrEv_wash) my hair .
 Then she raised_(RelNScrEv) me up again and turned_(RelNScrEv) me back around .
 The whole time she was cutting_(ScrEv_cut) my hair , I could see_(ScrEv_look_mirror) what she was doing_(UnrelEv) in the mirror and she talked_(ScrEv_small_talk) to me .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very pleasant and not at all scary .
 Once my haircut was_(UnrelEv) finished , she dried_(ScrEv_dry) it with a dryer and then brushed_(ScrEv_brush_hair) the hair off of the cape before she took_(ScrEv_remove_cap) the cape off of me .
 Finally , she asked_(ScrEv_customer_opinion) me if I liked_(UnrelEv) my haircut and I did_(UnrelEv) so I paid_(ScrEv_pay) and gave_(ScrEv_leave_tip) her a tip .

 The kids card only allows_(UnrelEv) you to check_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) two books a week , and only from the children 's room .

 So , I used_(ScrEv_check_catalog) the card catalog to find_(RelNScrEv) two more books and then took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) all my books back to the front desk to check_(ScrEv_register) them out .
 The lady at the front desk scanned_(ScrEv_register) a bar code in the back of the book and that registered_(ScrEv_register) them as checked_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) to me .

 Soon it was_(UnrelEv) 6:00 PM and my father was waiting_(UnrelEv) outside to pick_(UnrelEv) me up .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_book) both books to the front desk and had_(UnrelEv) the librarian check_(ScrEv_register) them out for me .
 I was_(UnrelEv) so excited to continue_(UnrelEv) reading_(RelNScrEv) them and I went_(ScrEv_leave) outside and we drove_(UnrelEv) home .

 I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) local_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) in my town yesterday .
 I was dying_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) the new book by James Patterson .
 I love_(UnrelEv) mysteries !
 I was_(UnrelEv) n't sure where to find_(ScrEv_get_shelf) the mystery section in the library so I asked_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) the librarian .
 She entered_(ScrEv_use_computer) the book information into the computer and then told_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) me where I could find_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the book .
 As it turned_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) , the mystery section was clearly labeled_(RelNScrEv) , as were_(UnrelEv) the books .
 They were_(UnrelEv) in alphabetical order by author .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_shelf) the P section and located_(ScrEv_look_for_book) books by Patterson .
 It was_(UnrelEv) easy to find_(ScrEv_take_book) my book .
 I took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) the book up to the checkout desk .
 The librarian asked_(ScrEv_show_card) for my library card .
 A library card has_(UnrelEv) my name on it and a computer code on it .
 The librarian swiped_(ScrEv_register) my card and told_(RelNScrEv) me that my book was_(ScrEv_return_book) due_(ScrEv_return_book) back in two weeks .
 I thanked_(RelNScrEv) her for helping_(RelNScrEv) me .
 She told_(RelNScrEv) me that she hoped_(UnrelEv) I enjoyed_(RelNScrEv) the book .

 I often make_(ScrEv_get_library) several trips to the library so my library card is_(UnrelEv) always left in my wallet and I never have to search_(UnrelEv) for it .
 Today , I had to return_(ScrEv_return_book) a book but I also wanted_(UnrelEv) to borrow_(Evoking) a new one .
 I had recently finished_(UnrelEv) an introductory book on learning_(UnrelEv) a new language and wanted_(UnrelEv) to replace_(RelNScrEv) it with something more enjoyable .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_library) out to the library .
 It was_(UnrelEv) only a few minutes away and I only had to cross_(UnrelEv) a few streets .
 Walking_(UnrelEv) past the small store , I found_(ScrEv_go_check_out) the reception desk where a librarian was waiting_(UnrelEv) for me .
 I checked_(ScrEv_register) back in my book on a new language and checked_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the rest of the library .
 I scanned_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the aisles for the fiction and fantasy sections .
 Once found_(RelNScrEv) , I just picked_(ScrEv_take_book) some random books until I was able to choose_(ScrEv_take_book) one that seemed_(UnrelEv) interesting enough to read_(RelNScrEv) .
 I took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) my book back to the reception desk and had it checked_(ScrEv_register) out with my library card .

 I needed to learn_(UnrelEv) about gardening_(UnrelEv) and was n't sure where to start_(UnrelEv) .
 A friend of mine recommended_(UnrelEv) a book .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to check_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) out_(Evoking) from_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) local_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library .
 Inside there was_(UnrelEv) a computer to look_(ScrEv_use_computer) up_(ScrEv_use_computer) where books are located_(UnrelEv) .
 I typed_(ScrEv_use_computer) in the name of the book I was looking_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for and it showed_(RelNScrEv) me the call number , a unique number used_(UnrelEv) to tell_(UnrelEv) where the book is located_(UnrelEv) in the library .
 I wrote_(ScrEv_note_shelf) the call number down and looked_(ScrEv_look_for_book) at the stacks of books .
 Each stack had_(UnrelEv) a range of numbers printed_(UnrelEv) on a card taped_(UnrelEv) to the side of the bookshelf .
 I looked_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for my call number on the printed_(UnrelEv) cards on the side of the bookshelves , then searched_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the books until I found_(RelNScrEv) the one I was looking_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for .
 I brought_(ScrEv_go_check_out) the book up to the front of the library .
 The librarian took_(RelNScrEv) my library card and scanned_(ScrEv_register) it and my book with a special scanner .
 She gave_(ScrEv_get_receipt) me a piece of paper inside the book that said_(UnrelEv) I needed to bring_(RelNScrEv) it back within 2 weeks .
 I brought_(ScrEv_leave) the book home and read_(RelNScrEv) it , then brought_(RelNScrEv) it back to the librarian .

 I love reading_(UnrelEv) , and the library provides_(UnrelEv) an endless array of books to choose_(RelNScrEv) from .
 When I go_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) , I browse_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the various sections to select_(ScrEv_other) the books I ' m going to check_(RelNScrEv) out .
 Sometimes I ' m_(UnrelEv) in the mood for mystery , other times I prefer_(UnrelEv) humor .
 After flipping_(ScrEv_other) through some books in the different sections , I make_(UnrelEv) my choices .
 I usually choose_(RelNScrEv) a few books to check_(RelNScrEv) out .
 With my selections and library card in hand , I make_(ScrEv_go_check_out) my way to the front desk and wait_(ScrEv_wait) in line .
 When it is_(UnrelEv) my turn , I present_(ScrEv_show_card) my library card to the librarian .
 She scans_(ScrEv_register) the books to check_(ScrEv_register) them out under my name .

 I have_(UnrelEv) 2 weeks to enjoy_(UnrelEv) the books before returning_(ScrEv_return_book) them back to the library .

 I was_(UnrelEv) bored one weekend and decided_(UnrelEv) I would like_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) a new book .
 I checked_(UnrelEv) in my wallet to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) I had_(UnrelEv) my library card .
 Seeing_(UnrelEv) that I did in fact have_(UnrelEv) the card , I got_(UnrelEv) in my car and drove_(ScrEv_get_library) to the nearest branch of the public library , about four miles from my home .
 When I went_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) , I first checked_(ScrEv_browse_releases) out_(ScrEv_browse_releases) the new arrivals , both fiction and non-fiction .
 Then I looked_(ScrEv_look_for_book) at biographies , then at the books on the stacks for favorite authors .
 I finally decided_(RelNScrEv) on a few selections , two from the new fiction section and one from the new non-fiction section , as well as a book on poetry .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_check_out) to the check-out desk and presented_(RelNScrEv) the books along with my card to the librarian .
 She checked_(ScrEv_register) the books out to me along with a receipt which told_(UnrelEv) me when the books were_(UnrelEv) due back .

 There were_(UnrelEv) so many good books that it was_(UnrelEv) difficult to pick_(ScrEv_take_book) out_(ScrEv_take_book) just a few , so I used_(ScrEv_use_computer) the library 's computer book search program .
 Eventually I chose_(ScrEv_take_book) several modern plays , a biography , and a book on ancient Rome .
 I took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) these books up to the librarian 's desk and asked_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) if I could check_(ScrEv_register) them out .
 She said_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) yes , I could borrow_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) books_(Evoking) , but I needed to sign_(ScrEv_obtain_card) up_(ScrEv_obtain_card) for a library card .
 I filled_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) the form , and she took_(RelNScrEv) it .
 Then she made_(RelNScrEv) my library card and gave_(RelNScrEv) it to me .
 With this accomplished_(UnrelEv) , I was_(UnrelEv) able to check_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) my books .
 She put_(ScrEv_get_receipt) a card in each one with a date stamped_(RelNScrEv) on it .
 This was_(UnrelEv) the date the books were_(UnrelEv) due to be returned_(ScrEv_return_book) .
 I promised_(UnrelEv) to return_(ScrEv_return_book) them on time and took_(ScrEv_leave) the books home to read_(RelNScrEv) .

 After reading_(ScrEv_other) the back cover I was excited_(UnrelEv) about the contents of the book .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_book) the book up to the front of the library where the librarian sat_(RelNScrEv) at her desk .
 I informed_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) her that I found_(ScrEv_take_book) the book I wanted_(UnrelEv) and was ready to check_(ScrEv_register) out .

 The library called_(UnrelEv) and a book that I had asked_(UnrelEv) to be notified_(UnrelEv) when it came_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) to the library was_(UnrelEv) back in .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library that is_(UnrelEv) downtown .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) up to the librarians ' desk and asked_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) for my book .
 The librarian went_(UnrelEv) away to a set of shelves behind the counter and returned_(UnrelEv) with the book .
 I went_(UnrelEv) and sat_(RelNScrEv) on a chair and looked_(RelNScrEv) the book over to see_(RelNScrEv) if it was_(UnrelEv) something that I really did want to read_(RelNScrEv) .
 The book looked_(UnrelEv) interesting so I went_(ScrEv_go_check_out) back to the counter and waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line .
 The line was_(UnrelEv) long today .
 I found_(UnrelEv) my library card in my wallet and waited_(ScrEv_wait) some more .
 The librarian came_(UnrelEv) over_(UnrelEv) and smiled_(UnrelEv) at me .
 Then when it was_(UnrelEv) my turn at the counter , I handed_(RelNScrEv) the book to the person behind the desk .
 She scanned_(ScrEv_register) my library card and the book .
 I left_(ScrEv_leave) the library with book in hand .

 Last week I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) get_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) book_(Evoking) .
 One of my friends had recommended_(UnrelEv) that I read_(RelNScrEv) a book called_(UnrelEv) The Chocolate Wars .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library Saturday afternoon .
 I walked_(UnrelEv) into the main area on the first floor and went_(UnrelEv) to a computer terminal , where I looked_(ScrEv_use_computer) up the book by its title .
 The library catalog gave_(UnrelEv) me a call number that identified_(UnrelEv) where the book was stored_(RelNScrEv) .
 I wrote_(ScrEv_note_shelf) the call number down on a little slip of paper , then I took_(UnrelEv) the slip of paper and went_(ScrEv_other) to the shelves where the books are_(UnrelEv) .
 At the end of each row of book shelves , there are_(UnrelEv) signs that told_(UnrelEv) me which books were_(UnrelEv) in that row .
 I found_(ScrEv_other) the row where the number I was looking_(UnrelEv) for was_(UnrelEv) , then I looked_(UnrelEv) at the numbers on the books on those shelves until I found_(ScrEv_other) the number that matched_(UnrelEv) The Chocolate Wars .
 I pulled_(ScrEv_take_book) the book off the shelf and liked_(UnrelEv) the cover , so I decided_(UnrelEv) I would go_(UnrelEv) ahead and read_(RelNScrEv) it as my friend suggested_(UnrelEv) .
 I took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) the book to the circulation desk and gave_(ScrEv_other) it to the librarian with my library card .
 The librarian swiped_(ScrEv_other) my library card through an electronic reader and told_(RelNScrEv) me the book would be_(UnrelEv) due in two weeks .
 I thanked_(RelNScrEv) her and left_(ScrEv_leave) the library .

 I was sitting_(UnrelEv) home on a Saturday afternoon and was quite bored_(UnrelEv) .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) that I would enjoy_(UnrelEv) reading_(RelNScrEv) , but I did n't have_(UnrelEv) any books that I had n't read_(RelNScrEv) at home .
 So , off I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) .
 I got_(RelNScrEv) in my car and drove_(ScrEv_get_library) a mile down the street until I reached_(ScrEv_get_library) the library .
 Once there I browsed_(ScrEv_look_for_book) through the fiction books as those are_(UnrelEv) my favorite until I found_(ScrEv_look_for_book) a book that I thought_(UnrelEv) I would like_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) .
 I picked_(ScrEv_take_book) up_(ScrEv_take_book) the book and took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) it up to the front desk .
 I pulled_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) my library card and the librarian scanned_(ScrEv_register) the book and then scanned_(ScrEv_show_card) my card .
 She put_(RelNScrEv) a bookmark in the book and told_(RelNScrEv) me when the book would be_(ScrEv_return_book) due_(ScrEv_return_book) back .
 I thanked_(RelNScrEv) her and proceeded_(UnrelEv) to walk_(ScrEv_leave) out_(ScrEv_leave) to my car .
 I drove_(RelNScrEv) home and began_(UnrelEv) reading_(RelNScrEv) the book and it was_(UnrelEv) very enjoyable to read_(RelNScrEv) .

 Reading_(RelNScrEv) is_(UnrelEv) very important to me , and with the amount that I read_(RelNScrEv) , it is_(UnrelEv) economical to use_(RelNScrEv) a library to borrow_(Evoking) the books I would like to read_(RelNScrEv) .
 When borrowing_(Evoking) a book , I get_(UnrelEv) my son into the car and we drive_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library .
 Usually we find_(ScrEv_look_for_book) a few books for him to borrow_(ScrEv_take_book) as well , so we go_(ScrEv_get_shelf) to the children 's section first and pick_(ScrEv_take_book) out two or three books for him .
 That way , when we go_(ScrEv_get_shelf) to find_(ScrEv_look_for_book) a book for me , he has_(UnrelEv) something to entertain_(UnrelEv) him .
 Then we go_(ScrEv_get_shelf) to the fiction section for adults .
 Usually my son Ryan will sit_(UnrelEv) on the floor looking_(RelNScrEv) at his books next to me while I find_(ScrEv_look_for_book) book to check_(ScrEv_register) out .
 I find_(ScrEv_look_for_book) a book or two and then Ryan and I go_(ScrEv_go_check_out) to the check out and use_(ScrEv_show_card) my library card to check_(ScrEv_register) out the books .
 The librarian usually puts_(ScrEv_other) them in a bag and then we leave_(ScrEv_leave) the library to go_(UnrelEv) home and enjoy_(UnrelEv) our books .

 I went_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library to find books about making_(UnrelEv) a set of wooden shelves .
 I asked_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) the librarian for help and she pointed_(RelNScrEv) me towards the right section .
 I looked_(ScrEv_look_for_book) at all the books on woodworking until I found_(ScrEv_other) a few that I felt_(UnrelEv) had_(UnrelEv) the information I needed_(UnrelEv) to build_(UnrelEv) the shelves .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_book) the books that I needed_(UnrelEv) to the librarian and she told_(UnrelEv) me that they now have_(UnrelEv) a self-checkout .
 She showed_(ScrEv_other) me how the system worked_(UnrelEv) and assigned_(RelNScrEv) me a pin code .
 They gave_(ScrEv_obtain_card) me a new library card that will let_(UnrelEv) me use_(UnrelEv) the self check out .
 So I scanned_(ScrEv_other) my library card and put_(ScrEv_other) in my pass code .
 I scanned_(ScrEv_register) each of the books i had chosen_(RelNScrEv) and then clicked_(UnrelEv) on the button to print_(ScrEv_other) my receipt .
 This new system will make_(UnrelEv) going_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) much faster .
 I gathered_(ScrEv_other) my books and left_(ScrEv_leave) the library and went_(UnrelEv) home to start_(UnrelEv) my book shelves .

 A week ago I decided_(UnrelEv) I wanted_(UnrelEv) to go_(ScrEv_get_library) to the local library and borrow_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) book_(Evoking) .
 This is_(UnrelEv) something I have n't done_(UnrelEv) since I was_(UnrelEv) a kid , so I was_(UnrelEv) n't sure if the process had changed_(UnrelEv) .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_library) over to the library which was_(UnrelEv) about 5 miles away from my house .
 When I arrived_(ScrEv_get_library) I walked_(ScrEv_get_library) inside and was surprised_(UnrelEv) to discover_(UnrelEv) the interior had dramatically changed_(UnrelEv) since the last time I had been_(Unclear) there .
 Once I composed_(UnrelEv) myself , I began_(UnrelEv) my quest to search_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for a good book .
 I did_(UnrelEv) n't have anything particular in mind , but then I thought_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) to the times when I was_(UnrelEv) a kid and liked_(RelNScrEv) books about medieval history .
 So I went_(ScrEv_get_shelf) over to the history section to see_(ScrEv_look_for_book) what they had_(RelNScrEv) .
 I found_(ScrEv_take_book) a book about knights and medieval combat that looked_(RelNScrEv) interesting , so I took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) it to the front desk to check_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) .
 I first had to sign_(ScrEv_obtain_card) up_(ScrEv_obtain_card) for a library card , and after that was done_(UnrelEv) I drove_(ScrEv_leave) home with the book .

 I love_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) , and today I remembered_(UnrelEv) that I had already finished_(RelNScrEv) my last mystery novel .
 So now it was_(UnrelEv) time to head_(ScrEv_get_library) back to the library .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a short walk , but one I enjoyed_(UnrelEv) as I considered_(UnrelEv) what kind of stories I would check_(Evoking) out_(Evoking) next .
 I dropped_(ScrEv_return_book) my return books into the slot at the entrance , and entered_(ScrEv_get_library) the library .
 Oh how I love_(UnrelEv) the smell of books !
 I made_(ScrEv_get_shelf) my way over to the fiction area , and randomly layed_(ScrEv_look_for_book) eyes on the book bindings , until a title would catch_(RelNScrEv) my eye .
 After 2 to 3 more , I would take_(ScrEv_go_check_out) my selections to the check out desk .
 The librarian , who knows_(UnrelEv) me well , smiled_(RelNScrEv) and noted_(ScrEv_register) the books I had chosen_(ScrEv_take_book) in the system .
 The library has_(UnrelEv) a scanner now .
 It makes_(Unclear) the check out process so much faster now .
 I picked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the books on the other side , placed_(ScrEv_other) them in my bag , and stepped_(ScrEv_leave) out_(ScrEv_leave) into the autumn air .

 After enrolling_(UnrelEv) in a basic college geometry class , I realized_(UnrelEv) very early on that I needed to supplement_(UnrelEv) what I was learning_(UnrelEv) in class with an additional book that went_(UnrelEv) over some of the basics that I had forgotten_(UnrelEv) since high school .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_library) to the local library and searched_(ScrEv_look_for_book) through many of the ones that were_(UnrelEv) available .
 The college course I was taking_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) very important and I wanted to do_(UnrelEv) well in it .
 After 1 hour of searching_(ScrEv_look_for_book) I found_(RelNScrEv) a book that was perfectly written_(UnrelEv) for people that wanted_(UnrelEv) a refresher course in the subject of geometry .
 I read_(RelNScrEv) about 5 pages of it while in the library and realized_(UnrelEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) a perfect fit for my needs .
 I walked_(ScrEv_go_check_out) up to the checkout counter and checked_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) the book for two weeks .
 I took_(RelNScrEv) the book home and read_(RelNScrEv) it and I am_(UnrelEv) very glad I did_(UnrelEv) so .
 I am_(UnrelEv) glad I have_(UnrelEv) a great library nearby .

 I went_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) in town the other day because I really want_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) this book that my friend told_(UnrelEv) me about .
 After driving_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library , I went_(RelNScrEv) to the main desk to inquire_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) about the book .
 The librarian kindly greeted_(RelNScrEv) me and searched_(ScrEv_use_computer) for the book on her card catalog computer system .
 She saw_(ScrEv_use_computer) that there were_(UnrelEv) 2 copies available in the New Books section .
 She and I walked_(ScrEv_get_shelf) upstairs to the New Books area and we were_(UnrelEv) able to find_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the book .
 I thanked_(RelNScrEv) her for help .
 Then I walked_(ScrEv_go_check_out) back downstairs to check_(ScrEv_register) the book out .
 The check out lines were_(RelNScrEv) all full but there were_(RelNScrEv) a couple self-checkout machines available .
 After checking_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) the book , I went_(ScrEv_leave) home and read_(RelNScrEv) it .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very good and I finished_(RelNScrEv) it in 2 days .
 The next day , I returned_(ScrEv_return_book) the book to the library for the next eager patron to enjoy_(RelNScrEv) .

 I used_(UnrelEv) to go_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) all the time .
 I am_(UnrelEv) a complete bookworm , and since I do n't have_(UnrelEv) the time to read_(RelNScrEv) completely through a 200 page novel anymore , I do n't borrow_(Evoking) books_(Evoking) very often anymore .
 I loved_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) look_(RelNScrEv) through all the fiction books .
 The science fiction and fantasy novels always caught_(RelNScrEv) my eye .
 I am_(UnrelEv) just in love with the creative imagination involved_(UnrelEv) with writing_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) such beautiful worlds and bringing_(UnrelEv) me into them to see_(UnrelEv) what they see_(UnrelEv) .
 So after I had chosen_(ScrEv_take_book) my book , I would go_(ScrEv_go_check_out) up to the desk .
 When I was checking_(ScrEv_register) them out , you had to bring_(RelNScrEv) your library card so they could scan_(ScrEv_show_card) it .
 They would then scan_(ScrEv_show_card) the card , scan_(ScrEv_register) each book , and give_(ScrEv_get_receipt) you a card with a stamped_(UnrelEv) due date on it .
 You could bring_(ScrEv_return_book) it back before that time , or , if the book was_(UnrelEv) n't insanely popular and had_(UnrelEv) no one waiting_(ScrEv_wait) on it , you could recheck_(ScrEv_register) it out if you needed_(UnrelEv) more time to read_(RelNScrEv) .

 Today I decided_(UnrelEv) to borrow_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) book_(Evoking) from the local library .
 I got_(UnrelEv) dressed and headed_(ScrEv_get_library) out to the library .
 I was_(UnrelEv) n't really sure what kind of book I wanted_(UnrelEv) , other than a good novel or piece of fantasy fiction , so I started_(ScrEv_look_for_book) my search in the fiction section .
 I browsed_(ScrEv_other) the first few pages of several books while I was at the library to see if any interested_(UnrelEv) me .
 Eventually , I came_(ScrEv_take_book) across a fantasy novel that looked_(UnrelEv) really interesting_(UnrelEv) to me .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_book) it up to the librarian and borrowed_(ScrEv_other) the book out for a week .
 The librarian collected_(ScrEv_other) some information for me and asked_(ScrEv_show_card) for my library card , before stamping_(ScrEv_other) my name in the back of the book .
 I took_(ScrEv_leave) the book home and read_(RelNScrEv) it over the next several days .
 Once I was done_(UnrelEv) , I made_(UnrelEv) sure to return_(ScrEv_return_book) the book to the library before the due date , dropping_(ScrEv_return_book) it off in the library 's return box .

 I had just watched_(UnrelEv) a movie , and saw_(UnrelEv) that it had been based_(UnrelEv) on a book .
 Since I liked_(UnrelEv) the movie , I wanted to read_(RelNScrEv) the book and went_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library in my neighborhood to see_(ScrEv_look_for_book) if they had_(UnrelEv) it .
 In the library the books were separated_(UnrelEv) into fiction and non-fiction areas .
 Since the story was_(UnrelEv) about something that happened_(UnrelEv) in real life , it would be_(UnrelEv) in the non-fiction area .
 If it were_(UnrelEv) a make-believe story , it would have been_(UnrelEv) in the fiction section .
 The person who wrote_(UnrelEv) the book had_(UnrelEv) a last name that began_(UnrelEv) with S. I began_(UnrelEv) looking_(ScrEv_look_for_book) on the shelves for authors with the last name that began_(UnrelEv) with S. All the books were_(UnrelEv) in alphabetical order according_(UnrelEv) to the authors last name .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) the book I was looking_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for and took_(ScrEv_take_book) it off the shelf .
 I brought_(ScrEv_go_check_out) it to the desk where the librarian was_(UnrelEv) and gave_(RelNScrEv) her the book .
 She asked_(RelNScrEv) me for my library card , which gives_(UnrelEv) me permission to borrow_(Evoking) books_(Evoking) .
 She entered_(RelNScrEv) my information into her computer so she would know_(UnrelEv) who borrowed_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) book_(Evoking) .
 She told_(RelNScrEv) me the book would be_(UnrelEv) due back in the library in two weeks .
 If I did n't bring_(RelNScrEv) it back by then , I would have to pay_(UnrelEv) the library money for every day the book was_(UnrelEv) late .
 I did n't want to have_(UnrelEv) any late fees , so I made sure I brought_(RelNScrEv) it back on time .
 Since the book belonged_(UnrelEv) to the library , I took_(UnrelEv) good care of it so others could enjoy_(UnrelEv) the book when they borrowed_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .

 Yesterday I used_(UnrelEv) my new library card to borrow_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) book_(Evoking) .
 It was so easy !
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_library) down to the library early in the morning , just as soon as the library opened_(RelNScrEv) .
 When I entered_(ScrEv_get_library) the library , I said_(UnrelEv) hi to the lady behind the counter , and went_(ScrEv_other) over to the science fiction section to look_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for a book that might catch_(UnrelEv) my fancy .
 I soon found_(ScrEv_other) a very good looking_(UnrelEv) book about a boy who meets an alien in his backyard .
 I really wanted_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) the book , but I knew_(UnrelEv) it would take_(UnrelEv) me a few days , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to borrow_(RelNScrEv) it for awhile .
 I brought_(ScrEv_go_check_out) the book up to the lady at the counter , and she asked_(UnrelEv) me for my library card .
 I showed_(ScrEv_show_card) it to her , and she entered_(ScrEv_other) some information in the computer .
 She told me to bring_(RelNScrEv) the book back in one week .
 I promised_(UnrelEv) I would , then I thanked_(RelNScrEv) her and went_(ScrEv_leave) home to read_(RelNScrEv) the book !

 I love_(UnrelEv) going_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) check_(Evoking) out_(Evoking) books_(Evoking) .
 It is_(UnrelEv) probably one of my favorite places to go_(UnrelEv) to , since I 'm_(UnrelEv) a fairly avid reader .
 Anyway , I 'll usually bike_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library and bring_(UnrelEv) a backpack with me so that I can easily bring_(RelNScrEv) my books home .
 The last time I went_(UnrelEv) , I was looking_(UnrelEv) for some books on local folklore for a class that I 'm taking_(UnrelEv) .
 I quickly went_(UnrelEv) to one of the computer search stations and typed_(ScrEv_use_computer) in the last name of an author that I knew_(UnrelEv) had written_(UnrelEv) a book on the subject .
 I got_(UnrelEv) back a couple more results than I had expected_(UnrelEv) , so I made_(ScrEv_note_shelf) note of them .
 Then , I searched_(ScrEv_use_computer) by just the topic of folklore , along with the tribe that I was covering_(UnrelEv) .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) several books that looked_(UnrelEv) like they might be_(UnrelEv) interesting .
 So , I took_(ScrEv_note_shelf) the numbers for where they would be and headed_(UnrelEv) off towards the Stacks .
 I followed_(UnrelEv) the numbers to the different rows and picked_(ScrEv_take_book) up the books that I needed_(UnrelEv) , as well as a couple other books that also sounded_(UnrelEv) interesting .
 My arms full , I took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) them all to the checkout counter , where a nice older man scanned_(ScrEv_register) them and gave_(ScrEv_other) me a printed_(UnrelEv) receipt that said_(UnrelEv) when I would need to have_(UnrelEv) them back by .
 All in all , it was_(UnrelEv) a pretty productive trip to the library .

 I 've always liked_(UnrelEv) libraries , they 're_(UnrelEv) usually nice and quiet and you never know_(UnrelEv) what kind of interesting books you might find_(RelNScrEv) when you 're looking_(UnrelEv) around .
 I started_(UnrelEv) by looking_(ScrEv_browse_releases) at the new arrival shelves , but nothing there really caught_(UnrelEv) my eye .
 I headed_(UnrelEv) over to one of the library computers and brought_(ScrEv_use_computer) up the book search .
 It took_(UnrelEv) me a little while to decide_(UnrelEv) what kind of book I wanted_(UnrelEv) , but eventually decided_(UnrelEv) I wanted_(UnrelEv) a science fiction book , just something to enjoy_(UnrelEv) for a little while .
 I started_(UnrelEv) browsing_(ScrEv_use_computer) through all the search results until a book caught_(UnrelEv) my eye .
 I noted_(ScrEv_note_shelf) down the shelf number it should be_(UnrelEv) in and went_(ScrEv_other) over to it .
 I found_(RelNScrEv) my book and took_(ScrEv_take_book) it to the desk , where I gave_(ScrEv_show_card) the librarian my library card and the book .
 He checked_(ScrEv_register) it out for me and handed_(ScrEv_other) them back .
 After that , I headed_(ScrEv_leave) home and sat_(UnrelEv) down to read_(RelNScrEv) my book .

 I went_(ScrEv_get_library) to my local library and had to sign_(RelNScrEv) up as a member because I previously was_(UnrelEv) not a member .
 After signing_(ScrEv_obtain_card) up for a membership , I now had_(UnrelEv) two options ; I could ask_(RelNScrEv) the librarian for help , or I could use_(RelNScrEv) the self service computers and find_(RelNScrEv) the location of my book on my own .
 I chose_(UnrelEv) to find_(UnrelEv) the book on my own , because if I can avoid_(UnrelEv) dealing_(UnrelEv) with people I will always pick_(UnrelEv) that option .
 So I go_(ScrEv_use_computer) on the computer and type_(ScrEv_use_computer) the name of the book in .

 Now I go_(ScrEv_get_shelf) to the location .

 She took_(RelNScrEv) me to the right area and I looked_(ScrEv_look_for_book) at all of the choices .
 There were_(UnrelEv) so many !
 I chose_(ScrEv_other) a few that I thought_(UnrelEv) looked_(UnrelEv) really interesting .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_book) the books I had chosen_(RelNScrEv) and walked_(ScrEv_go_check_out) over to the self checkout area .
 I pulled_(ScrEv_show_card) out my library card and scanned_(ScrEv_other) it with the scanning wand .
 I then used the wand to scan_(ScrEv_register) the bar code on each of the books .
 When they had all been scanned_(ScrEv_register) I checked_(ScrEv_other) the screen to make_(UnrelEv) sure everything was_(UnrelEv) correct .
 I clicked_(UnrelEv) on the button to print_(ScrEv_get_receipt) my receipt .
 I put_(UnrelEv) the receipt inside one of the books , picked_(ScrEv_other) up the books and went_(ScrEv_leave) out the door .
 I could hardly wait_(UnrelEv) to get home and start_(UnrelEv) reading_(RelNScrEv) .

 I waited_(UnrelEv) too long to start_(UnrelEv) working_(UnrelEv) on my report that was_(UnrelEv) due for my class .
 I was_(UnrelEv) in a hurry , and had_(UnrelEv) to get_(Evoking) some_(Evoking) research_(Evoking) material_(Evoking) for the assignment .
 Sadly , one of the requirements for this report was_(UnrelEv) to have_(UnrelEv) a couple citations from a book instead of other articles that can_(UnrelEv) easily be found_(UnrelEv) on the internet .
 After an hour of searching_(RelNScrEv) for my library card , I found_(RelNScrEv) it at last and head_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 After I arrived_(ScrEv_get_library) I had to ask_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) the librarian where they kept_(RelNScrEv) such books .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a while since I have been_(Unclear) in there .
 After finding_(ScrEv_get_shelf) the section .
 I carefully looked_(ScrEv_look_for_book) through the books that caught_(UnrelEv) my eye and picked_(ScrEv_take_book) the book that I needed_(RelNScrEv) for my report .
 I walked_(ScrEv_go_check_out) up_(ScrEv_go_check_out) to the librarian , and borrowed_(ScrEv_register) the book .
 But not without paying_(RelNScrEv) an old book fee I had_(UnrelEv) from a year ago .
 After I paid_(RelNScrEv) , I walked_(ScrEv_leave) out_(ScrEv_leave) with the book in hand ready to do_(RelNScrEv) some research .

 In need of a new series to sink_(UnrelEv) my teeth into , I decided_(UnrelEv) to head_(Evoking) to_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) .
 I ca n't seem_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) long without reading_(RelNScrEv) some mythical , crazy fantasy !
 Anyway , when I got_(ScrEv_get_library) to the Library , I sat_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) at their computer where you can look_(ScrEv_use_computer) up_(ScrEv_use_computer) where certain books are_(UnrelEv) in the library .
 I found_(ScrEv_use_computer) where the fantasy section was_(UnrelEv) and headed_(ScrEv_get_shelf) over_(ScrEv_get_shelf) to that shelf .
 Oh my goodness , there were_(UnrelEv) more books than I could ever imagine_(UnrelEv) !
 I was practically drooling_(UnrelEv) !
 I saw_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the series I was looking_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for_(ScrEv_look_for_book) and decided_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_take_book) just the first book in the series -LRB- so I do n't binge_(RelNScrEv) read_(RelNScrEv) -RRB- .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_book) the book up to the front counter and handed_(ScrEv_show_card) the librarian my member card so that I could check_(ScrEv_register) the book out .
 She looked_(RelNScrEv) the book over and commented_(RelNScrEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) one of her favorites which made_(UnrelEv) me smile_(RelNScrEv) .
 With the book now checked_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) , I slipped_(ScrEv_other) it into my page and made_(ScrEv_leave) my way home .
 I was_(UnrelEv) ready to dive_(UnrelEv) into a new adventure !

 It only took_(UnrelEv) me a moment from there to find_(ScrEv_take_book) the book I wanted_(ScrEv_look_for_book) .
 Book in hand , I went_(ScrEv_go_check_out) back to the library counter .
 I told_(UnrelEv) the librarian I 'd like to borrow_(ScrEv_register) the book .
 She wrote_(ScrEv_register) my information down and on the insert in the book , and gave_(ScrEv_get_receipt) me a due date .
 Then I was_(ScrEv_leave) on my way .

 I am_(UnrelEv) an avid reader so I am_(UnrelEv) always on the lookout for the next best story of nonfiction !
 My buddy , Frank , told_(UnrelEv) me about the new library that was opening_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) about a mile away from my house and I thought_(UnrelEv) this was_(UnrelEv) a great opportunity to be_(UnrelEv) able to borrow_(Evoking) some_(Evoking) free_(Evoking) books_(Evoking) !
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_library) down_(ScrEv_get_library) and was_(UnrelEv) in awe at how big the place was_(UnrelEv) .
 As I stepped_(ScrEv_get_library) inside and began_(UnrelEv) to browse_(ScrEv_browse_releases) I realized_(UnrelEv) that not only did they have_(RelNScrEv) books but they had_(RelNScrEv) video games , DVDs , and music you could rent_(Unclear) as well .
 After spending_(UnrelEv) about half an hour in there just browsing_(ScrEv_browse_releases) I finally came_(ScrEv_look_for_book) upon_(ScrEv_look_for_book) a book I wanted_(UnrelEv) to read_(RelNScrEv) : The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy !
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_take_book) the book and went_(ScrEv_go_check_out) up_(ScrEv_go_check_out) to the counter .
 The nice librarian said_(UnrelEv) that I would first have to get_(ScrEv_obtain_card) a library card so I could rent_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) my book .
 I filled_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) the paper work and she handed_(RelNScrEv) me a shinny new library card !
 I rented_(ScrEv_register) my book and she told_(RelNScrEv) me that I was_(ScrEv_return_book) due_(ScrEv_return_book) by a week from today .
 I went_(ScrEv_leave) back home and got_(UnrelEv) started_(UnrelEv) on my reading adventure .

 A few months ago , I went_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library to check_(Evoking) out_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) couple_(Evoking) of_(Evoking) books_(Evoking) .
 Our local library is_(UnrelEv) very large and full of very interesting books , magazines and movies .
 Before I went_(ScrEv_get_shelf) to find_(ScrEv_look_for_book) my books , I stopped_(RelNScrEv) at the coffee shop in the library .
 I ordered_(RelNScrEv) a coffee and a blueberry muffin so I could have_(RelNScrEv) a snack .
 Once I finished_(RelNScrEv) my snack , I began_(UnrelEv) to look_(ScrEv_look_for_book) for_(ScrEv_look_for_book) my books .
 I used_(ScrEv_use_computer) the library 's computer to find_(ScrEv_use_computer) the location of each book .
 Finding_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the books only took_(UnrelEv) me about 10 minutes .
 After I found_(ScrEv_take_book) the books , I sat_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) in a comfortable chair that was_(UnrelEv) next to a lamp .
 I began_(UnrelEv) reading_(RelNScrEv) one of my books while I was drinking_(RelNScrEv) my coffee .
 I stayed_(RelNScrEv) at the library and read_(RelNScrEv) for about thirty minutes .
 I went_(ScrEv_go_check_out) to the checkout to check_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) my books , and then I left_(ScrEv_leave) to walk_(RelNScrEv) home .

 I 'd been looking_(UnrelEv) forward to reading_(RelNScrEv) Tigerman , the new novel by my favorite writer , Nick Harkaway .
 However , I do n't like paying_(RelNScrEv) for the hard cover editions of books , and the paperback version would not be released_(UnrelEv) for another year .
 I therefore decided_(UnrelEv) to walk_(ScrEv_get_library) to my local library and borrow_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) book_(Evoking) .
 To my disappointment , it was already checked_(RelNScrEv) out , but I was able to place_(ScrEv_other) a hold on the book .
 Six weeks later , the library sent_(ScrEv_other) me an e-mail to let_(UnrelEv) me know that Tigerman had been returned_(RelNScrEv) and I could now check_(RelNScrEv) it out .
 I stopped_(ScrEv_get_library) by on my way home from work that evening , and got_(ScrEv_other) the book .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a fun read , but I was not able to finish_(UnrelEv) it by the due date , so I went_(UnrelEv) online and obtained_(ScrEv_other) an extension of the due date .
 A few days later , I finished_(UnrelEv) the book , which was wonderful .
 I wanted_(UnrelEv) other people to be able to enjoy_(UnrelEv) it too , so I promptly returned_(ScrEv_return_book) the book to the library .

 Sometimes I buy_(UnrelEv) books but more often I just decide_(UnrelEv) to borrow_(Evoking) one_(Evoking) from_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) public_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) because you can read_(RelNScrEv) them and take_(RelNScrEv) them back and it does n't cost_(UnrelEv) you anything .
 Most libraries have_(UnrelEv) a vast selection of books so you would never be_(UnrelEv) unable to find_(RelNScrEv) something you wanted to read_(RelNScrEv) .
 A lot of libraries have_(UnrelEv) their catalog online so you can check_(ScrEv_check_catalog) to see if they have_(UnrelEv) a particular book before you go_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library .
 I recently had to join_(RelNScrEv) a new library so I went_(ScrEv_get_library) there and spoke_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) to the lady behind the desk who asked_(UnrelEv) me to fill_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) a form with my address and contact details , and provide_(RelNScrEv) proof of my identity .
 When I had finished_(UnrelEv) filling_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) the form , I took_(UnrelEv) it back to her and she made_(RelNScrEv) me a little plastic library card with my account number and my name on it , along with a unique barcode .
 She told_(UnrelEv) me I had to use_(UnrelEv) this card to check_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) books whenever I went_(ScrEv_get_library) to the library .
 There were_(UnrelEv) thousands of books on hundreds of shelves , all of them are filed_(UnrelEv) in some sort of order .
 Fiction books were filed_(UnrelEv) by author surname , and non-fiction books were filed_(UnrelEv) by a system called the Dewey decimal system which numbers_(UnrelEv) books according to their subject classification and are then filed_(UnrelEv) in that number order .
 The books were_(UnrelEv) easy to find_(RelNScrEv) , there were_(UnrelEv) computers around the library where you could check_(ScrEv_use_computer) to see_(ScrEv_look_for_book) what books were_(UnrelEv) available .
 When I had selected_(ScrEv_take_book) the books I wanted to borrow_(Evoking) I went_(ScrEv_go_check_out) to one of the self service stations and scanned_(ScrEv_register) the barcode on the books and the barcode on my new library card , and the books were issued_(ScrEv_register) to me .
 I also got_(ScrEv_get_receipt) a printed_(UnrelEv) receipt to show me when the books were_(UnrelEv) due to be returned_(RelNScrEv) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very easy to do_(UnrelEv) .

 Finally I stood_(ScrEv_go_check_out) in the line for the check out counter .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) my turn , I gave_(ScrEv_other) the person at the counter the book that I chose_(RelNScrEv) .
 They asked_(RelNScrEv) me for the membership card but that is when I realized_(UnrelEv) that I did n't have_(UnrelEv) one .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to apply_(RelNScrEv) for a new membership card .
 All that was needed_(UnrelEv) for the membership application was my ID card .
 I gave_(RelNScrEv) them my driving license .
 I was given_(ScrEv_obtain_card) a new membership card within 5 minutes .
 I used_(ScrEv_show_card) it to borrow_(ScrEv_other) the book that I selected_(RelNScrEv) .
 I was told_(UnrelEv) that the book needs_(UnrelEv) to be returned_(RelNScrEv) within 7 days .
 Overall the experience was_(UnrelEv) a nice one and I would keep_(UnrelEv) going_(UnrelEv) there .

 If you ask_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) politely where a certain book is_(UnrelEv) , they are_(UnrelEv) more than happy to help_(RelNScrEv) you find_(RelNScrEv) the book .
 So once you find_(ScrEv_other) the book you are looking_(RelNScrEv) for , you take_(ScrEv_take_book) it to the checkout desk and present_(ScrEv_show_card) them with your library card , then they punch_(RelNScrEv) the card into their computer system and scan_(ScrEv_register) the barcode on the book so they have_(UnrelEv) a record of who has_(UnrelEv) what book .

 We went_(ScrEv_get_shelf) along_(ScrEv_get_shelf) the bookshelves until we found_(ScrEv_get_shelf) the correct number range , then started_(UnrelEv) searching_(ScrEv_look_for_book) the shelves by the author 's last name .

 It is_(UnrelEv) my favorite hobby and I spend_(UnrelEv) a majority of my time either at home reading_(RelNScrEv) or at the library finding_(RelNScrEv) new books to read_(RelNScrEv) .

 You simple give_(ScrEv_show_card) them your card and they let_(UnrelEv) you take_(ScrEv_take_book) the book home for a long enough period to read_(RelNScrEv) and bring_(ScrEv_return_book) back .

 I needed_(UnrelEv) to write_(UnrelEv) a school report on tigers , and I decided_(UnrelEv) to visit_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) library_(Evoking) to find_(RelNScrEv) a book to use_(UnrelEv) in my research .
 When I entered_(ScrEv_other) the library , I saw_(UnrelEv) hundreds of books on many different shelves and was_(UnrelEv) not sure where to find_(RelNScrEv) books on tigers .
 I asked_(ScrEv_ask_librarian) a librarian for help finding_(RelNScrEv) books on tigers .
 Are you looking_(UnrelEv) for stories about tigers , or facts and photographs about tigers ?
 she asked_(UnrelEv) me .
 I told_(UnrelEv) her I wanted_(UnrelEv) facts and real information so I can write_(UnrelEv) a report .
 She walked_(UnrelEv) over to a group of shelves labeled_(RelNScrEv) Nonfiction and told_(UnrelEv) me that these books all had_(UnrelEv) true facts and pictures , rather than being_(UnrelEv) imaginary stories .
 They are put_(RelNScrEv) in a special order using_(UnrelEv) number codes called the Dewey Decimal System .
 Using_(UnrelEv) these codes , all the books on tigers would be_(UnrelEv) in the same place and would be_(UnrelEv) very close to books about other animals .
 She looked_(RelNScrEv) up the Dewey Decimal System code for tigers and wrote_(ScrEv_note_shelf) it down for me .
 Walking_(ScrEv_look_for_book) through the shelves with my code , I saw_(UnrelEv) that the numbers on the spines of the books start_(UnrelEv) at zero and keep_(UnrelEv) getting_(UnrelEv) bigger and bigger .
 Finally , I was getting_(UnrelEv) close to the number she wrote_(RelNScrEv) down for me .
 There I saw_(UnrelEv) books about lions , cheetahs , and finally tigers .
 I found_(ScrEv_other) a book that looked_(UnrelEv) like it would be_(UnrelEv) helpful for my report and brought_(ScrEv_other) it back to the librarian .
 She asked_(RelNScrEv) me for my library card , and after I handed_(ScrEv_show_card) it to her , she scanned_(ScrEv_other) it with her computer .
 Next , she scanned_(ScrEv_register) a barcode on the back of the book .
 Now the book was checked_(ScrEv_register) out in my name so that the library would know_(UnrelEv) who has_(UnrelEv) the book .
 She handed_(RelNScrEv) me the book and told_(UnrelEv) me that I needed_(UnrelEv) to bring_(ScrEv_return_book) it back to the library in two weeks .
 If I did n't bring_(ScrEv_return_book) it back , I would have to pay_(RelNScrEv) a fine for every day I kept_(UnrelEv) it , because other people might want to read_(RelNScrEv) the book too .
 I thanked_(RelNScrEv) her and went_(ScrEv_leave) home to work_(UnrelEv) on my report .

 Once she checked_(ScrEv_return_book) it in , she let_(UnrelEv) me have_(ScrEv_take_book) it and I then checked_(ScrEv_register) it out .
 I had to show_(ScrEv_show_card) her my library card , and she told_(RelNScrEv) me my due date to return_(ScrEv_return_book) the book was_(UnrelEv) in two weeks .

 I found_(ScrEv_check_catalog) the Dewey Decimal number and then went_(ScrEv_get_shelf) down the rows of shelves until I got_(ScrEv_get_shelf) to the right number .
 There were_(UnrelEv) so many books !
 I have_(UnrelEv) a small yard , so I thought_(UnrelEv) a book on container gardening_(UnrelEv) would be_(UnrelEv) best .
 I chose_(ScrEv_take_book) one with lots of pictures .
 I then took_(ScrEv_go_check_out) the book to the circulation desk and waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line behind a mother with a child .
 The child had_(Unclear) about twenty picture books .
 This could be_(UnrelEv) a while .

 I thought it might be already checked_(ScrEv_register) out_(ScrEv_register) , or maybe they did n't have_(UnrelEv) it yet , but I wanted to check_(RelNScrEv) before I spent_(UnrelEv) the money on a hard-cover copy of the book .

 It took_(RelNScrEv) barely a few hours to get_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) there , so we decided_(UnrelEv) to look_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the window at the scenery most of the time .
 None of us became_(RelNScrEv) sick , which was_(UnrelEv) another one of our worries .
 My partner suffers_(UnrelEv) from light vertigo .
 The staff on the train were_(UnrelEv) exceptionally nice , and offered_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) us snacks on occasion .
 The train was_(UnrelEv) a great idea for the trip we had planned_(UnrelEv) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) much nicer than driving_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) the interstate .

 Last summer , I got_(UnrelEv) to visit_(RelNScrEv) my grandma in Seattle !
 I took_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) to visit_(RelNScrEv) her .
 In advance , I called_(RelNScrEv) the train station to see_(ScrEv_check_time-table) when the trains would be going_(RelNScrEv) to Seattle and how much the tickets would cost_(RelNScrEv) .
 I chose_(RelNScrEv) a day and arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the train station 1 hour before my train was scheduled_(UnrelEv) to leave_(ScrEv_train_departs) .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a ticket counter in the station .
 I walked_(RelNScrEv) up the counter and bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket from a lady behind the counter .
 After I got_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket , I needed to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for the train to board_(ScrEv_get_on) passengers .
 I sat_(ScrEv_wait) on a big wooden bench inside the train station .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) time to get_(ScrEv_get_on) on_(ScrEv_get_on) the train , the doors opened_(RelNScrEv) and a ticketperson took_(RelNScrEv) each of our tickets as we got_(ScrEv_get_on) on_(ScrEv_get_on) the train .
 We got_(UnrelEv) to choose_(ScrEv_find_place) our seats .
 I choose_(ScrEv_find_place) a window seat and put_(RelNScrEv) my bags in the compartment nearby .
 Partway through the ride , a train employee came_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) with snacks and drinks .
 I looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out the window and read_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a book .
 When we arrived_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) in Seattle , I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) my bags from the baggage compartment , exited_(ScrEv_get_off) the train , and hugged_(UnrelEv) my waiting_(UnrelEv) grandma !

 On the weekend I caught_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) into the city .
 Before I left_(UnrelEv) my house in the morning , I checked_(RelNScrEv) the train timetable online .
 I then walked_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station .
 At the train station , I went_(UnrelEv) to the ticket booth and asked_(RelNScrEv) for one return ticket to where I wanted_(UnrelEv) to go_(UnrelEv) .
 I paid_(RelNScrEv) the man at the booth and he gave_(ScrEv_get_tickets) me my ticket .

 I was taking_(UnrelEv) a day trip to another city not too far away .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) by_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 I looked_(ScrEv_other) up a timetable for trains leaving_(RelNScrEv) my city and going_(UnrelEv) to the new city , and arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the station not too long before my train was_(UnrelEv) due to arrive_(RelNScrEv) .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to the ticket booth and bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket .
 Then I walked_(ScrEv_get_platform) to the platform to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for my train to arrive_(RelNScrEv) .
 The platform was_(UnrelEv) a little high in the air , and I could see_(UnrelEv) the tracks on the ground below .
 Looking_(UnrelEv) across the tracks , there was_(UnrelEv) a similar platform on the other side for trains coming_(RelNScrEv) from the other direction .
 I heard_(UnrelEv) some clatter and a loud whistle , and saw_(UnrelEv) that my train was heading_(ScrEv_train_arrives) toward my platform .
 I stood_(UnrelEv) behind a line painted_(UnrelEv) on the floor of the platform , as it kept_(UnrelEv) me a safe distance from the arriving_(ScrEv_train_arrives) train .
 Finally , it stopped_(RelNScrEv) , and the doors opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) up .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_on) on board and found_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat next to a window .
 When everyone was_(UnrelEv) on board , the doors closed_(ScrEv_other) and the train whistled_(RelNScrEv) again to let everyone know_(UnrelEv) that it was leaving_(ScrEv_train_departs) .
 The train rolled_(ScrEv_train_departs) down the tracks .
 It was very roomy on the train and I was able to walk_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) up and down the aisle while the train was moving_(RelNScrEv) .
 Finally , it arrived_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) at my destination and I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off .
 Riding_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) an easy and pleasant experience .

 Recently I was invited_(UnrelEv) to a function at a church with a downtown location .
 I live_(UnrelEv) in a large city that has_(UnrelEv) trains that travel_(RelNScrEv) within the city and also go_(RelNScrEv) to nearby towns .
 There are_(UnrelEv) several routes that the trains travel_(RelNScrEv) called lines and they are named_(UnrelEv) by colors : red , green and orange .
 This is_(UnrelEv) so passengers know_(UnrelEv) what train to take_(Evoking) to get_(RelNScrEv) where they want to go_(RelNScrEv) .
 The last time I went_(UnrelEv) to that church I had_(UnrelEv) a lot of trouble finding_(UnrelEv) a parking spot , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) there .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that the train station was_(UnrelEv) only a few blocks away from the church so it would be_(UnrelEv) easy to get_(RelNScrEv) to the church .
 I drove_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station closest to my house , and parked_(UnrelEv) the car in the parking lot .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the station , where there were_(UnrelEv) many benches for passengers to sit_(RelNScrEv) while they waited_(ScrEv_wait) for their trains .
 There was_(UnrelEv) a machine on the platform that let_(UnrelEv) you choose_(UnrelEv) what type of ticket you needed_(UnrelEv) .
 You could buy_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a ticket for only going_(RelNScrEv) one way or a round trip .
 I chose_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the round trip ticket since I wanted to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) to the church and back again .
 The machine had_(UnrelEv) a display that told_(UnrelEv) me how much money I needed to deposit_(ScrEv_get_tickets) in the little slot .
 I put_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the money in the machine and my ticket popped_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) for my train to arrive_(ScrEv_train_arrives) .
 When it did_(UnrelEv) , the doors opened_(ScrEv_door_opens) and lots of people got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the train .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_on) on_(ScrEv_get_on) and everyone who was waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for the train got_(ScrEv_get_on) on_(ScrEv_get_on) , too .
 I looked_(RelNScrEv) for_(RelNScrEv) a seat .
 I picked_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat that was facing_(UnrelEv) forward , but there were_(UnrelEv) seats that faced_(UnrelEv) the center of the train and even ones that faced_(UnrelEv) backward .
 The train 's doors shut_(RelNScrEv) and the train started_(UnrelEv) to move_(ScrEv_train_departs) along the rail .
 It went_(RelNScrEv) very fast .
 The train had_(UnrelEv) windows on both sides and I looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) at the sights as we sped_(RelNScrEv) along_(RelNScrEv) .
 In a few minutes it stopped_(RelNScrEv) at another station , and some people got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and others got_(ScrEv_get_on) on_(ScrEv_get_on) .
 Pretty soon the conductor walked_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) up and down the aisle asking_(RelNScrEv) to see_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) everyone 's ticket .
 I showed_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) her my ticket and she nodded_(UnrelEv) and smiled_(UnrelEv) .
 At the next station , the train stopped_(RelNScrEv) .
 This was_(UnrelEv) the station that was_(UnrelEv) closest to the church , so I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) time to go_(RelNScrEv) home , I waited_(ScrEv_wait) at the station for the train that would take_(RelNScrEv) me home again .
 Taking_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) a lot of fun , and sometimes a lot easier than driving_(UnrelEv) .

 Some people ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) every day as part of their work commute , while others only have_(UnrelEv) the opportunity to ride_(Evoking) for vacation or pleasure .
 I spend_(UnrelEv) quite a good amount of time researching_(ScrEv_check_time-table) routes and fares before I decide_(UnrelEv) on the best options for me .

 I feel_(UnrelEv) like I 'm partaking_(UnrelEv) in a part of our shared_(UnrelEv) history , something people have been doing_(UnrelEv) for hundreds of years .
 I enjoy_(UnrelEv) sitting_(ScrEv_find_place) by the window and watching_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the scenery race_(RelNScrEv) past .
 Making_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) small talk with other passengers is_(UnrelEv) also something I look_(UnrelEv) forward_(UnrelEv) to .
 An employee comes_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) to ensure_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) that everyone has paid_(ScrEv_get_tickets) their fare .

 The other day , I had to catch_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) from Los Angles to New York at the last minute .
 My boss wanted_(UnrelEv) me to meet_(UnrelEv) some foreign client in a brand new art gallery they recently bought_(UnrelEv) in Manhattan .
 The boss called_(UnrelEv) me at about 5:30 in the morning and told_(UnrelEv) me that he already bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) tickets to get_(RelNScrEv) from here to New York , but explained_(UnrelEv) to me that he could n't make_(UnrelEv) it as he had_(UnrelEv) another meeting to that same morning .
 The tickets were_(UnrelEv) for a train that departed_(ScrEv_train_departs) at 7:15 am , so like a good worker bee , I got_(UnrelEv) up , skipped_(UnrelEv) showering_(UnrelEv) , got dressed_(UnrelEv) , and ran_(UnrelEv) out the door with a dirty wrinkled_(UnrelEv) suit I had n't had_(UnrelEv) time to wash_(UnrelEv) .
 The airport was_(UnrelEv) 40 minutes away so I had_(UnrelEv) very little time to spare_(UnrelEv) .
 I managed_(UnrelEv) to store_(RelNScrEv) my car and walk_(ScrEv_get_platform) into the train station half asleep right at 7:10 am when I overheard_(RelNScrEv) my train was delayed_(RelNScrEv) over the intercom .
 When my train was called_(RelNScrEv) an hour later , I drowsily made_(ScrEv_find_place) my way on board where I got_(ScrEv_find_place) a window seat next to a larger fellow .
 I remember_(UnrelEv) I was_(UnrelEv) half asleep when I mumbled_(UnrelEv) a hello to him .
 He happily greeted_(UnrelEv) me back as I sat_(ScrEv_find_place) down .
 Right before the train took_(ScrEv_train_departs) off and the trains stewardesses were telling_(RelNScrEv) us how to use_(RelNScrEv) our seat belts , I barely remember_(UnrelEv) ending_(UnrelEv) up falling_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) asleep on the large man next to me .
 Four hours later , I got_(UnrelEv) a nudge from the large man next to me telling_(UnrelEv) me kindly to wake_(UnrelEv) up and that our ride_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) over .
 I distinctly remember_(UnrelEv) waking_(UnrelEv) up with a mouthful of drool soaked on the large man ' s arm I feel_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) asleep on and instantly apologized_(UnrelEv) .
 He laughed_(UnrelEv) and said_(UnrelEv) to me Don ' t worry_(UnrelEv) about it !
 You looked_(UnrelEv) so tired_(UnrelEv) !
 Would you believe_(UnrelEv) this is n't the first time this has happened_(UnrelEv) to me ?
 We both kind of laughed_(UnrelEv) and went_(UnrelEv) on our ways .
 It ended_(UnrelEv) up being_(UnrelEv) a great ride_(Evoking) and sleep , overall .

 It was suggested_(UnrelEv) to me to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) down south as it is_(UnrelEv) cheaper than driving_(UnrelEv) and flying_(UnrelEv) .

 I went_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the Amtrak station in Boston and found_(RelNScrEv) the ticket office .
 As I stood_(RelNScrEv) in line , I looked_(ScrEv_check_time-table) at the board showing_(UnrelEv) all the departure times to New York .

 Chennai is_(UnrelEv) 800 kms far away from my place and it takes_(UnrelEv) about 15 hours if I drive_(UnrelEv) .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 I went_(UnrelEv) online and booked_(ScrEv_get_tickets) tickets .
 The economy tickets were sold_(RelNScrEv) out so I had to book_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the expensive one .
 On the day of the travel , I arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the train station almost an hour before the actual departure time .
 Since it was_(UnrelEv) a first class ticket , I could take_(RelNScrEv) more than enough luggage with me .
 After 15 minutes in to the journey , the ticket collector came_(UnrelEv) by and checked_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) my tickets .
 It was_(UnrelEv) early in the morning and I was_(UnrelEv) in a window seat .
 So I could watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) all the scenery .
 Another good thing about the train is_(UnrelEv) that once in a while I could get_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) up and walk_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a stretch .
 Also , when I 'm_(UnrelEv) hungry , I could get_(RelNScrEv) down at the station and buy_(UnrelEv) any food as the train stops_(RelNScrEv) at the station for 10-15 minutes .
 Overall it was_(UnrelEv) a wonderful experience .

 I used_(UnrelEv) my debit card to pay_(RelNScrEv) and selected_(UnrelEv) the option to collect_(UnrelEv) the ticket at the train station .
 I arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the train station in plenty of time because I know_(UnrelEv) there can be_(UnrelEv) long queues at the machines where tickets are collected_(UnrelEv) .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) my turn at the ticket machine , I followed_(UnrelEv) the instructions and input_(RelNScrEv) my ticket reference number , which I had stored_(UnrelEv) on my smartphone .

 Last winter , my husband and I took_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) to Chicago .
 Before the train trip , we had to check_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the train schedule to find_(ScrEv_check_time-table) out_(ScrEv_check_time-table) what choices we had_(UnrelEv) about when we could leave_(ScrEv_train_departs) .
 We found_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the train schedule on the World Wide Web .

 After we paid_(ScrEv_get_tickets) for our tickets , they were emailed_(RelNScrEv) to us , and then we printed_(RelNScrEv) them .
 On the day of our trip , we drove_(ScrEv_get_train_station) our car to the train station , which is_(UnrelEv) about 10 miles away from our house .
 We parked_(RelNScrEv) at the station , and because it 's_(UnrelEv) a little train station instead of a big city , we did n't have to pay_(UnrelEv) for parking_(RelNScrEv) .
 We took_(RelNScrEv) our suitcases and went_(ScrEv_get_platform) to the platform , where other people were waiting_(ScrEv_wait) .
 Eventually -LRB- a little late -RRB- , the train pulled_(ScrEv_train_arrives) in_(ScrEv_train_arrives) .
 There were_(RelNScrEv) already passengers on the train from other stops .
 We boarded_(ScrEv_get_on) the train and found_(ScrEv_find_place) two seats near each other .

 We explained_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) to him that sometimes they have to do_(UnrelEv) that at the stations , and it was_(UnrelEv) nothing to be concerned_(UnrelEv) about .

 I presented_(RelNScrEv) my ticket to the conductor and got_(ScrEv_get_on) on_(ScrEv_get_on) .
 Then I spent_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the train ride reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) some books that I had packed_(RelNScrEv) , sleeping_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) , and looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) at the scenery .
 While it was_(UnrelEv) a lot of effort to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) , in the end I found_(UnrelEv) it to be_(UnrelEv) an affordable and relaxing_(UnrelEv) experience

 When I went_(UnrelEv) on vacation last year with my parents , we took_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) for part of it .
 We picked_(RelNScrEv) the route we wanted_(UnrelEv) to take_(RelNScrEv) to go visit_(UnrelEv) my uncle , and had_(RelNScrEv) everything ready the day before , such as our suitcases .
 When the day arrived_(RelNScrEv) for us to go_(UnrelEv) , my dad drove_(ScrEv_get_train_station) us to the train station where we parked_(RelNScrEv) in a designated_(UnrelEv) lot , since we would be returning_(RelNScrEv) to the same train station .
 We then headed_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station and went_(ScrEv_get_train_station) inside where my dad purchased_(ScrEv_get_tickets) our tickets .
 We had_(UnrelEv) some extra time , so we wandered_(ScrEv_wait) around and found_(UnrelEv) a little gift shop where we could buy_(UnrelEv) souvenirs .
 When it was_(UnrelEv) time to board_(ScrEv_get_on) our train , we walked_(ScrEv_get_platform) through the station to get_(ScrEv_get_platform) to the correct area .
 There were_(UnrelEv) long hallways to get_(ScrEv_get_platform) there , and then we went_(ScrEv_get_platform) up a concrete pathway to where the train was_(RelNScrEv) outside .
 We had to give_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) the ticket taker our tickets so she could verify_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) we were getting_(ScrEv_get_on) on the right train .
 We all gathered_(ScrEv_get_on) in the train and found_(ScrEv_find_place) some seats that had n't been taken_(RelNScrEv) .
 We stored_(ScrEv_other) our luggage and prepared_(UnrelEv) for the train to begin_(UnrelEv) its journey_(Evoking) .
 Once it was_(UnrelEv) time to leave_(ScrEv_train_departs) , we watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out the windows at all the passing_(UnrelEv) scenery .
 After awhile , we all started_(UnrelEv) doing_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) our own thing like reading_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) or playing_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) cards to pass_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the time .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a lot of fun and really neat to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) .

 Last month I decided_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) my grandmother .
 She lives_(UnrelEv) about three hours away from me , and I do not own_(UnrelEv) a car .
 To get_(UnrelEv) to her house safely , I wanted_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 Trains are_(UnrelEv) a very affordable way to travel_(RelNScrEv) , and I find_(UnrelEv) them to be_(UnrelEv) comfortable and pleasant .
 I got_(UnrelEv) on my computer , and went_(RelNScrEv) to the website where people buy_(ScrEv_get_tickets) train tickets .
 I chose_(RelNScrEv) a date to leave_(ScrEv_train_departs) and I booked_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my tickets .
 My tickets were emailed_(RelNScrEv) to me and I printed_(ScrEv_get_tickets) them off using_(UnrelEv) my printer .
 A week later , I went_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station and boarded_(ScrEv_get_on) the train .
 The ride was_(UnrelEv) very quiet , so I took_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a nap part of the ride .
 The seats were_(UnrelEv) very comfortable .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) to the cafeteria cart on the train and bought_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) coffee .
 I enjoyed_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the coffee and drank_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) it while looking_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the window .
 I really enjoyed_(UnrelEv) the whole experience .

 Yes going_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) , this is was_(UnrelEv) our ideal weekend activity not too long ago .
 We purchased_(ScrEv_get_tickets) tickets to travel_(RelNScrEv) from Boston to New York City .
 As we entered_(ScrEv_get_platform) the platform of the train is was_(UnrelEv) pure steel and looked_(UnrelEv) so solidly strong .
 We walked_(RelNScrEv) down the isle and found_(ScrEv_find_place) an comfortable looking_(UnrelEv) seat and decided_(UnrelEv) to sit_(ScrEv_find_place) there .
 Shortly the train horn blasted_(RelNScrEv) making me jump_(UnrelEv) of my seat lol .
 Anyway we soon started_(UnrelEv) moving_(ScrEv_train_departs) and our train_(Evoking) ride_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) underway .
 The conductor walked_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) the isles and collected_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) our tickets .
 love_(UnrelEv) scenery so I had_(UnrelEv) the window seat watching_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) everything along the way .
 First I saw_(UnrelEv) large suburban areas but as we got_(ScrEv_train_arrives) into Connecticut many farms were being spotted_(UnrelEv) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) n't very hilly but sure was_(UnrelEv) a country atmosphere .
 Soon we approached_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) NYC and the train came_(ScrEv_train_arrives) to slow stop , we had arrived_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) at our destination .
 The ride overall was_(UnrelEv) rather smooth and it did n't seem_(UnrelEv) to take_(RelNScrEv) all that long .

 I entered_(RelNScrEv) the train depot and went_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) to the window .
 I asked_(ScrEv_get_tickets) for a ticket to Chicago .
 I paid_(ScrEv_get_tickets) for it and clerk gave_(ScrEv_get_tickets) me my ticket .
 The train was already boarding_(ScrEv_get_on) , so I went_(ScrEv_get_platform) directly to the platform and boarded_(ScrEv_get_on) .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) down the aisle and found_(ScrEv_find_place) an empty seat .
 The train pulled_(ScrEv_train_departs) out_(ScrEv_train_departs) of the station .
 After a few minutes , the conductor came_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) and checked_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) my ticket , punching_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) it with a small hole punch .
 I looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the window .
 People 's houses and huge warehouses passed_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) .
 Later , as we got_(RelNScrEv) into the country , I saw_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a cow or two .
 After about a half hour we pulled_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) into the station in Chicago .
 The train pulled_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) and stopped_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) rather suddenly , throwing_(RelNScrEv) me forward a bit .
 I got_(ScrEv_move_exit) up_(ScrEv_move_exit) and went_(ScrEv_move_exit) down the aisle and exited_(ScrEv_get_off) the train , stepping_(ScrEv_get_off) down_(ScrEv_get_off) to the platform and exiting_(RelNScrEv) the station .

 Yesterday , I decided_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) my sister who lives_(UnrelEv) a few towns away .
 I wanted_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) because it is_(UnrelEv) cheaper than putting_(UnrelEv) gas in my car .
 So I drove_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station and parked_(UnrelEv) my car in the parking lot .
 I walked_(UnrelEv) to the cashier 's window and waited_(ScrEv_wait) in line .
 Once I reached_(UnrelEv) the front of the line , I greeted_(UnrelEv) the cashier and bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a train ticket .
 I walked_(ScrEv_get_platform) to the train platform and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the train to arrive_(RelNScrEv) .
 When the train finally arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) , I got_(ScrEv_get_on) on the train and located_(ScrEv_find_place) my seat , which was printed_(UnrelEv) on my ticket .
 I sat_(UnrelEv) in my seat and took_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out the magazine that I had brought_(UnrelEv) to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) on the ride .
 The train eventually started_(ScrEv_train_departs) back up and left_(ScrEv_train_departs) the station .
 Before long , a ticket taker came_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) over and asked_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) for my ticket to verify_(UnrelEv) that I had paid_(RelNScrEv) for my ride and was_(UnrelEv) in the correct seat .
 I greeted_(RelNScrEv) the ticket taker and gave_(ScrEv_other) him my ticket .

 After waiting_(ScrEv_wait) for a few minutes , my train was_(UnrelEv) ready to be boarded_(ScrEv_get_on) .
 I lined_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) with the other passengers and gave_(RelNScrEv) my ticket to the lady at the counter .
 We all boarded_(ScrEv_get_on) the train in an orderly fashion and waited_(RelNScrEv) until it was_(UnrelEv) time to depart_(ScrEv_train_departs) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) n't too long until it was_(UnrelEv) time for the train to go_(ScrEv_train_departs) .
 I quietly sat_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) by the window seat and looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) at the great scenery outside as the train went_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) .
 I would have never seen_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) some of the scenery had I not taken_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .

 She lives_(UnrelEv) in another area so I had to buy_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a train ticket .
 Since we planned_(UnrelEv) the trip early , I was able to save_(UnrelEv) a little bit of money .
 The trip would n't be_(UnrelEv) for another two weeks .

 Today , there were_(UnrelEv) n't any .
 About fifteen minutes later , my train showed_(ScrEv_train_arrives) up and I got_(ScrEv_get_on) on board .
 It was_(UnrelEv) crowded but not as much as one of the local trains .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure to listen_(RelNScrEv) for any announcements about what stops we were arriving_(RelNScrEv) at so I 'd know when I was_(UnrelEv) close to my destination .

 Yesterday my sons and I received_(UnrelEv) an invitation from their grandmother in Reno to come_(UnrelEv) for a visit .
 I do n't really like_(UnrelEv) to fly_(UnrelEv) on an airplane and I thought_(UnrelEv) taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) would be_(UnrelEv) a great way for my young sons to see_(UnrelEv) the country .
 So we went_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station and bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) train tickets .

 I taking_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) today from Boston , Massachusetts to New York City , New York .
 When I arrive_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the station , I see_(UnrelEv) an automated_(UnrelEv) machine that lets_(UnrelEv) me purchase_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket .
 I enter_(RelNScrEv) the necessary information about my travel and my credit card information and it dispenses_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a ticket to me .

 I board_(ScrEv_get_on) the train .
 There are_(UnrelEv) n't too many empty seats but I find_(ScrEv_find_place) a nice one next to the window .
 The train slowly pulls_(ScrEv_train_departs) out_(ScrEv_train_departs) of the station .
 About 20 minutes into the journey , a conductor comes_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) and asks_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) to see_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) my ticket .
 I show_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) it to him and he punches_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) a hole in it .
 He then rips_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) off_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) part of it and places_(RelNScrEv) the ripped_(UnrelEv) part into a special see through pocket in my seat .
 This is_(UnrelEv) so he knows_(RelNScrEv) that I have paid_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my fare to ride_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) about a three hour train ride so I get_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) and wander_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a few cars down to the food train .
 I purchase_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a coffee and donut and bring_(RelNScrEv) them back to my designated_(RelNScrEv) seat .

 I had to go_(RelNScrEv) 6 stops before I would arrive_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) to work so I took_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out my phone and decided_(UnrelEv) to send_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out some emails .
 After the first few stops the train started_(UnrelEv) to get quite crowded_(RelNScrEv) so I decided_(UnrelEv) to stand_(RelNScrEv) and give_(RelNScrEv) my seat up to an elderly gentleman .
 He was_(UnrelEv) thankful for the seat and I was_(UnrelEv) happy to do_(UnrelEv) him the favor .
 The train then arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) at my stop and I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off to make_(UnrelEv) my way to work .
 It was_(UnrelEv) another enjoyable experience_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .

 I remembered_(UnrelEv) the first long train_(Evoking) trip_(Evoking) i had_(UnrelEv) , it was_(UnrelEv) incredible .
 I was talking_(UnrelEv) to my family about going_(UnrelEv) on a trip to Virginia and they decided_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) about time we booked_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the trip .
 My dad called_(RelNScrEv) Amtrak -LRB- train company -RRB- and ordered_(ScrEv_get_tickets) 5 tickets for the next weekend .
 When the weekend came we got_(ScrEv_get_on) onto the train .
 This train was_(UnrelEv) different , it was_(UnrelEv) a double-decker or a train with two floors .
 We got_(ScrEv_find_place) to our seats and to the side was_(UnrelEv) huge windows that went_(UnrelEv) from the back of the train car to the front .
 I could n't believe_(UnrelEv) how incredible all the trees and birds looked_(UnrelEv) .
 Then we got_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) to the observation car .
 I did n't even think_(UnrelEv) this type of car existed_(UnrelEv) .
 The train car was_(UnrelEv) all class except for the floor and the lower parts of the wall , above was_(UnrelEv) all glass .
 Then we rode_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) in the observation and watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) as the rain fell_(UnrelEv) down .
 It was_(UnrelEv) an unbelievable event and I would highly recommend_(UnrelEv) it .

 I purchase_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket and then go_(UnrelEv) to sit_(RelNScrEv) down and wait_(ScrEv_wait) for my train .
 Whenever my train arrives_(ScrEv_train_arrives) I have to get_(ScrEv_wait) in line as they process_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) our tickets .
 After all this is done_(UnrelEv) I decide_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat by the window .
 I sit_(ScrEv_find_place) and fall_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) asleep a bit as I ride_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) for hours .

 Everyone lined_(RelNScrEv) up to get_(RelNScrEv) inside the doors .
 The doors open_(ScrEv_door_opens) and we all filed_(ScrEv_get_on) in .
 I found_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat by myself at the back of the train .
 I sat_(UnrelEv) down and looked_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) out the window at the passing_(UnrelEv) towns .
 After awhile , the announcer said_(RelNScrEv) the next and final stop would be_(UnrelEv) Chicago .
 I stood_(ScrEv_move_exit) up and walked_(ScrEv_move_exit) over to the doors .
 The train pulled_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) into the station , making_(UnrelEv) a loud screeching noise .

 As a young man I had_(UnrelEv) always enjoyed_(UnrelEv) watching_(UnrelEv) the trains go_(UnrelEv) by .
 Although there are_(UnrelEv) no passenger trains anywhere near where i live_(UnrelEv) there are trains that deliver_(UnrelEv) to local plants and factories .
 One day I decided_(UnrelEv) that as the train slowed_(RelNScrEv) down as it rumbled_(RelNScrEv) across the road while cars where stopped_(UnrelEv) I would run_(UnrelEv) and grab_(RelNScrEv) hold of one of the train car handles and sneak_(UnrelEv) a ride .
 Off I ran_(UnrelEv) .
 I grabbed_(RelNScrEv) the handle and thought my arm was going to rip_(UnrelEv) off as I tried_(UnrelEv) to pull_(RelNScrEv) myself onto the train .
 Finally I made_(UnrelEv) it and climbed_(RelNScrEv) up onto the top of the train car .
 I rode_(RelNScrEv) like that for several miles enjoying_(UnrelEv) the vibration and speed of the train as it rumbled_(RelNScrEv) along the tracks .
 When it slowed_(RelNScrEv) down enough before it 's next stop I jumped_(ScrEv_get_off) off and hit_(UnrelEv) the ground rolling_(UnrelEv) .

 The first and only time I have rode_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) in November 1978 .

 I had_(UnrelEv) a brother who attended_(UnrelEv) Southern Illinois University and we had_(UnrelEv) dinner with his family .
 The university is located_(UnrelEv) near Carbondale .
 I remember_(UnrelEv) the ride being_(UnrelEv) long but smooth .
 My sister and I took_(UnrelEv) turns sitting_(ScrEv_find_place) by the window .
 Sometimes all we saw_(RelNScrEv) was_(UnrelEv) cornfields and cattle .
 Occasionally , we would pass_(RelNScrEv) a small town and see_(RelNScrEv) people at different stops .
 We didn ' t order_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) food on the train because we brought_(RelNScrEv) our own .
 We actually had brought_(RelNScrEv) cakes , pies and sandwiches to carry_(RelNScrEv) us over .
 We shared_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) our food with the people around us .
 The whole car sang_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) Christmas carols and there was_(RelNScrEv) plenty of laughter .

 My train arrives_(ScrEv_train_arrives) quickly and I manage_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat because it was_(UnrelEv) n't too busy .
 After getting_(ScrEv_get_off) off the first train and switching_(ScrEv_other) for another train 45 minutes later , I arrived_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) at the destination and was_(UnrelEv) on time for the meeting .
 Now I have to repeat_(UnrelEv) the commute home after the meeting and hope_(UnrelEv) it will be_(UnrelEv) as smooth .

 Last month I wanted_(UnrelEv) to go visit_(UnrelEv) my parents in Florida , but I hate_(UnrelEv) to fly_(UnrelEv) .
 After thinking_(UnrelEv) about it for a little while , I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) not as fast as flying_(UnrelEv) but it is_(UnrelEv) a lot faster than driving_(UnrelEv) .
 I got_(RelNScrEv) on my computer and pulled_(ScrEv_check_time-table) up the train schedules to see_(UnrelEv) if there was_(UnrelEv) one that would work_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) me where I was going_(RelNScrEv) .
 After checking_(ScrEv_check_time-table) a few , I found_(ScrEv_check_time-table) one headed_(ScrEv_train_arrives) the way I needed_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) that was also running_(RelNScrEv) at the right time .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a round trip ticket right from the website .
 Since it would only take_(RelNScrEv) 10 hours to get_(ScrEv_train_arrives) there , I did n't bother_(UnrelEv) getting_(RelNScrEv) a spot in a sleeper car , just a regular seat .
 I packed_(ScrEv_other) up the things I needed_(UnrelEv) and headed_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station .
 Once I was_(ScrEv_get_train_station) there I checked_(RelNScrEv) in and got_(ScrEv_get_on) on the train .
 About 10 minutes later it was_(UnrelEv) time to go_(ScrEv_train_departs) and the train rumbled_(ScrEv_train_departs) out of the station .
 I had_(ScrEv_find_place) a window seat , so I could watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the scenery go_(RelNScrEv) by as we sped_(RelNScrEv) along the tracks .
 After a little while I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) up to the food car and get_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) some lunch .
 I sat_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) in the food car , ate_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) and played_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a game on my tablet .
 After a while I went_(RelNScrEv) back to my seat , plugged_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) my headphones into my tablet and just watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the country roll_(RelNScrEv) by while I listened_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) to my music .
 We got_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) to Florida on time and I had_(UnrelEv) a great visit with my parents , and best of all , I did n't have to fly_(UnrelEv) !

 When you need to go_(UnrelEv) outside the city limits of London , it is_(UnrelEv) best to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 Cars are_(UnrelEv) a poor choice as they hit_(UnrelEv) traffic often , as well as cost money to drive_(UnrelEv) , for me it is_(UnrelEv) far cheaper to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 This , of course , was when I lived_(UnrelEv) in London which I do_(UnrelEv) not do_(UnrelEv) now .
 Anyway , when I wanted_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) the beach town of Brighton I took_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to research_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the time schedule as to find_(ScrEv_check_time-table) the correct train and time .
 I found_(ScrEv_check_time-table) there was_(UnrelEv) one going_(UnrelEv) when I wanted_(UnrelEv) and it was leaving_(ScrEv_train_departs) from Victoria station .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_train_station) there early so as to purchase_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a ticket and get_(ScrEv_find_place) a good seat , I do n't like_(UnrelEv) traveling_(Evoking) backwards .
 Having bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket at the counter I walked_(ScrEv_get_platform) to the waiting_(RelNScrEv) train .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very nice and new and I had_(UnrelEv) little trouble finding_(ScrEv_find_place) a good seat .
 I settled_(ScrEv_find_place) in_(ScrEv_find_place) and closed_(RelNScrEv) my eyes , ready to rest_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) on the exceedingly comfortable train that was taking_(UnrelEv) me on an adventure .

 I recently needed_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) to a moderately distant city .
 Because it is_(UnrelEv) on the other side of a local mountain range , travel in my car would be_(UnrelEv) very hard on it , and I might get_(UnrelEv) lost .
 Fortunately there is_(UnrelEv) a passenger_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) that goes_(RelNScrEv) between out two cities .
 I had , before this trip , never been_(UnrelEv) on any kind of train bigger than one at the amusement park .
 I was very excited_(UnrelEv) for this opportunity .
 When I arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the station I was very pleased_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) that the train had_(UnrelEv) large windows .
 While on the trip these proved_(UnrelEv) to be wonderful for all of the gorgeous views provided_(UnrelEv) by nature .
 As my trip was_(UnrelEv) a half day journey .
 I stopped_(RelNScrEv) in the dining car for lunch , I found_(UnrelEv) it highly enjoyable to eat_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) on the train , and this also helped_(UnrelEv) to distract_(UnrelEv) me from the time .
 When I arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) in the other city I met_(UnrelEv) a friend who was eager to learn_(UnrelEv) about my trip .

 I like_(UnrelEv) to ride_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) trains_(Evoking) because you can see_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) lots of countryside without having to worry_(UnrelEv) about driving_(UnrelEv) .
 One time , when I lived_(UnrelEv) in Alaska , I rode_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) from Fairbanks to Denali park .
 Just like with all train rides , I had to buy_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a ticket first and then I had to stand_(RelNScrEv) in line to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for the train to stop_(ScrEv_train_arrives) at the station .
 Then I climbed_(ScrEv_get_on) onto the train and picked_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat .
 The different places you can sit_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) in a train are called_(UnrelEv) cars .
 You do n't have_(UnrelEv) assigned_(UnrelEv) seats like on a plane and the seats are_(UnrelEv) wide for more than one person to sit_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) .
 So , I picked_(ScrEv_find_place) one in a car in the back and sat_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) right beside the window .
 After the train started_(UnrelEv) moving_(ScrEv_train_departs) , a train attendant walked_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) through_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) to check_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) our tickets and then I stood_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) to walk_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) around_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) .
 You can walk_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) from car to car on a train and can even go_(UnrelEv) out of the back of the very last car and stand_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) outside , so I did_(UnrelEv) that .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very fun to be standing_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) outside while the train was moving_(RelNScrEv) and I hung_(RelNScrEv) onto the railing to be_(UnrelEv) sure I was_(UnrelEv) safe .
 Then I went_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) back inside and went_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) to the dining car where I bought_(RelNScrEv) a sandwich and water .
 After I got_(UnrelEv) back to my seat , I ate_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) and watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the scenery through the window .
 I saw_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) lots of interesting things including_(UnrelEv) a moose and we arrived_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) at Denali right after that .

 Instead of driving_(UnrelEv) up to visit_(RelNScrEv) my husband 's sister 's family in SF , we decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) !
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the tickets online and printed_(RelNScrEv) them out a few days before we left_(RelNScrEv) .
 I packed_(RelNScrEv) some bags and some snacks for our trip and made_(UnrelEv) some plans to go_(UnrelEv) to breakfast prior to departure .
 We were_(UnrelEv) late getting_(UnrelEv) out the door , of course .
 We parked_(UnrelEv) our car and got_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the station within a few minutes -LRB- luckily ! -RRB-
 .
 We carried_(UnrelEv) our suitcases onto the car , stored_(RelNScrEv) our luggage appropriately , and took_(ScrEv_find_place) our assigned_(UnrelEv) seats .
 I gave_(UnrelEv) my husband his ticket in the circumstance he wandered_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) off and was stopped_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) by an attendant .
 We began_(UnrelEv) to talk_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) about what we wanted to do_(UnrelEv) on our visit , as the train began_(UnrelEv) to roll_(ScrEv_train_departs) away from the station .
 He decided_(UnrelEv) to find_(UnrelEv) us coffee and breakfast , and I decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a quick nap while he was_(UnrelEv) gone , knowing_(UnrelEv) that it was_(UnrelEv) just an excuse to explore_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) for a bit .

 A few months ago , I took_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) to Sacramento to visit_(UnrelEv) my friend and her family .
 I had decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) because Sacramento is_(UnrelEv) 72 miles from the city I live_(UnrelEv) in and I am_(UnrelEv) not a good driver .
 I ordered_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the train tickets online a week before my trip and wrote_(ScrEv_other) down my confirmation number .
 When I got_(ScrEv_other) to the train station , I went_(UnrelEv) to a small self-service kiosk in the lobby and entered_(ScrEv_other) my personal information including my confirmation number , and printed_(ScrEv_get_tickets) out my train ticket .
 After that , I walked_(ScrEv_get_platform) up to the platform and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for my train .
 There were_(UnrelEv) several electronic displays that said_(UnrelEv) when the train would come_(RelNScrEv) , and I watched_(RelNScrEv) them impatiently .
 When the train arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) , I boarded_(ScrEv_get_on) behind another passenger and found_(ScrEv_find_place) a window seat so I could enjoy_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the view .
 I also liked_(UnrelEv) the seat because it had_(UnrelEv) a table in front of it .
 I had_(UnrelEv) a backpack with me which I put_(ScrEv_other) in the compartment above my seat .
 I put_(UnrelEv) my ticket on top of the table so it would be_(UnrelEv) easy to find_(UnrelEv) .
 A few minutes later , a worker came_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) by to check_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) passenger 's tickets , and after I showed_(RelNScrEv) him and he stamped_(RelNScrEv) it , I put_(UnrelEv) my ticket in my pocket .
 There were_(UnrelEv) not many people traveling_(UnrelEv) so no one sat_(UnrelEv) near me .
 The train departed_(ScrEv_train_departs) the station shortly after that .
 I fell_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) asleep on the train , but I woke_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) up well before my stop .
 When the train stopped_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) at my station , I grabbed_(ScrEv_other) my backpack and off_(ScrEv_get_off) boarded_(ScrEv_get_off) onto the platform .
 Then I went_(RelNScrEv) in to the train station and met_(UnrelEv) my friend who had come to pick_(UnrelEv) me up .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) that I wanted_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) a town that was_(UnrelEv) about an hour away from me .
 Rather than drive_(UnrelEv) , I decided_(UnrelEv) that it would be_(UnrelEv) a good day to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) ride_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure that I had_(RelNScrEv) all my things together and drove_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the train station .
 I parked_(UnrelEv) in the designated_(UnrelEv) parking lot across the street , and went_(ScrEv_get_train_station) into the small station .
 I waited_(ScrEv_wait) at the counter for a few minutes before an attendant strolled_(RelNScrEv) out from the office .
 She smiled_(UnrelEv) and asked_(UnrelEv) me where I would like to go_(RelNScrEv) .
 I told_(UnrelEv) her that I 'd like_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a round trip ticket for today to the nearby town .
 She got_(RelNScrEv) on her computer to confirm_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my route and times , and I decided_(UnrelEv) to purchase_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the tickets .
 I gave_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the attendant my money , and she put_(RelNScrEv) it in her drawer while my tickets printed_(ScrEv_get_tickets) off her printer .
 I thanked_(UnrelEv) her , and set_(UnrelEv) out the door to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for my train .
 Shortly after I sat_(RelNScrEv) down , I could hear_(RelNScrEv) the sound of the train in the distance .
 Once it was stopped_(ScrEv_train_arrives) and unloaded_(RelNScrEv) , the conductor shouted_(RelNScrEv) all aboard !
 and I gave_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) him my ticket .
 I boarded_(ScrEv_get_on) the train and set_(ScrEv_train_departs) off .
 And that 's_(UnrelEv) how I rode_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .

 I could hardly wait_(ScrEv_wait) until the train finally arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) .
 I climbed_(ScrEv_get_on) aboard , put_(RelNScrEv) my suitcases next to all the other people 's suitcases , and found_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat .
 Once the train started_(ScrEv_train_departs) going , the conductor came_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) to punch_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) everyone 's tickets .
 I gladly handed_(RelNScrEv) him mine to be punched_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) .
 After that , I decided_(UnrelEv) I would get_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) some lunch .
 I walked_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) to the back of the train to the lunch car and ordered_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) some food .
 It was_(UnrelEv) fun to eat_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) while watching_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the world pass_(RelNScrEv) by_(RelNScrEv) through the window as the train rolled_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) the tracks .

 This morning we needed_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) into the city .
 We grabbed_(RelNScrEv) our laptop computers to use_(UnrelEv) while we were going to be traveling_(UnrelEv) .
 We had to make_(UnrelEv) sure we also remembered_(UnrelEv) our passes to get_(ScrEv_get_on) on the train .
 As we arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the station , we saw_(UnrelEv) the train coming_(ScrEv_train_arrives) in .
 Many people got_(ScrEv_get_off) off the train when it arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) and then we entered_(ScrEv_get_on) the train .
 We were able to find_(ScrEv_find_place) seats even though the train was_(RelNScrEv) pretty full .
 As the train left_(ScrEv_train_departs) the station we started_(UnrelEv) working_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) on our computers , and the 20 minute ride_(Evoking) seemed_(UnrelEv) to just fly_(UnrelEv) by .
 The view of the city from the train was_(UnrelEv) beautiful .
 When we arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) at the station in the city , the people on the train started_(UnrelEv) to queue_(ScrEv_wait) up at the doorways .

 Every time I have to go_(UnrelEv) to the city , I have to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 One day , when I was_(Evoking) on_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) , I had to wait_(ScrEv_wait) twenty minutes for the next train to arrive_(ScrEv_train_arrives) .
 When it arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) , , the place was_(RelNScrEv) full .
 It was_(RelNScrEv) full because it was_(RelNScrEv) rush hour .
 That 's the time when everyone is coming_(UnrelEv) out of work or school .
 I could n't find_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat at all !
 I had to stand_(ScrEv_find_place) up throughout my whole ride_(Evoking) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very uncomfortable because I had to stand_(ScrEv_find_place) up for an hour ride_(Evoking) .
 To make_(UnrelEv) matters worse , more people wanted_(UnrelEv) to squeeze_(RelNScrEv) inside the train .
 Now everybody was_(UnrelEv) on top of one another .
 Soon , the train could n't move_(ScrEv_other) anymore because there were_(UnrelEv) just too many people on the train .
 The door would n't close_(ScrEv_other) therefore ; the conductor could n't drive_(ScrEv_other) the train .
 Eventually , people started_(UnrelEv) to come_(ScrEv_get_off) out and I was_(UnrelEv) able to breathe_(UnrelEv) .
 Finally , I reached_(ScrEv_train_arrives) my stop and was relieved_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) out of that train .

 Luckily I was_(UnrelEv) able to find_(RelNScrEv) all the necessary information to make_(UnrelEv) my trip possible .
 The next day I drove_(ScrEv_get_train_station) over to the train station and parked_(UnrelEv) in the secured parking lot .
 I went_(UnrelEv) over to the ticket booth and paid_(RelNScrEv) for a ticket , it cost_(RelNScrEv) me around $ 50 .
 I then waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the train to arrive_(ScrEv_train_arrives) .
 Once it did_(ScrEv_train_arrives) I got_(ScrEv_get_on) on board and stored_(ScrEv_other) my belongings in the luggage compartment .
 I then took_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat and relaxed_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) .

 After going_(ScrEv_get_platform) through the turnstile I waited_(ScrEv_wait) on the train platform for the train to enter_(ScrEv_train_arrives) the station .
 I quickly found_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat on the train since not to many people were_(UnrelEv) on it .
 After about 25 minutes I finally arrived_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) at the stop I was supposed_(UnrelEv) to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) at .
 I walked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the stairs and exited_(RelNScrEv) the train station and walked_(UnrelEv) 2 blocks away to where my friend lives_(UnrelEv) .

 This morning I arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the train station to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) to my sisters house in Texas .
 I had pre-purchased_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket for the Amtrak train leaving_(RelNScrEv) a 6 am .
 So I arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) around 30 minute before hand to check in and get to the platform in time to get my train .
 This was_(UnrelEv) the first time have taken_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) long_(Evoking) distance_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) and figured_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) similar to the local city trains I take_(RelNScrEv) to work each day .
 As the train boards_(ScrEv_other) I found_(ScrEv_find_place) my correct car and seat .
 I entered_(UnrelEv) the car and saw how much nicer these trains are compared_(UnrelEv) to the local one .
 The seats were_(UnrelEv) similar to seats on a tour coach , and was_(UnrelEv) actually quite nice inside .
 I brought_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a book along to read_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) and help_(UnrelEv) pass_(UnrelEv) the time .
 I settled_(UnrelEv) in my seat and a nice elderly woman sat_(UnrelEv) down next to me , We exchanged_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) pleasantries and she puled_(UnrelEv) out a blanket she was crocheting_(UnrelEv) for her grandson .
 I was_(UnrelEv) fascinated with her work and she started_(UnrelEv) to teach_(UnrelEv) me as the train pulled_(ScrEv_train_departs) away from the platform .
 She spent_(UnrelEv) most of the trip working_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) on the blanket as I watched_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) .
 Eight hours later , it seemed_(UnrelEv) like much less , the train pulled_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) into the station and it was_(UnrelEv) time for me to get_(ScrEv_get_off) off .
 I said_(UnrelEv) good bye to the woman and thanked_(UnrelEv) her for teaching_(UnrelEv) me what she had .
 She went_(UnrelEv) back to her work as I got_(ScrEv_get_off) off the train .
 My sister was waiting_(RelNScrEv) on the platform for me and we got_(UnrelEv) into her car and headed_(UnrelEv) to the nearest craft store to purchase_(UnrelEv) crocheting_(UnrelEv) supplies .

 I recently was able to enjoy_(UnrelEv) the privilege of riding_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 My friend and I had_(UnrelEv) quite a distance to travel_(RelNScrEv) .
 After some discuss with several option we decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) to our destination .
 We found_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) where the train station was located_(UnrelEv) and found_(RelNScrEv) the window to buy_(ScrEv_get_tickets) a ticket to our destination .
 We had_(UnrelEv) our choice of coaches but we chose_(RelNScrEv) the cheapest one which meant_(UnrelEv) hard seats that do not recline_(UnrelEv) , no air or food offered_(UnrelEv) in our car section .
 I had_(UnrelEv) no idea that it would take_(UnrelEv) 14 hours to travel_(RelNScrEv) to our destination .
 It really felt_(UnrelEv) like a lifetime , especially when you can not get_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) comfortable and find_(UnrelEv) a position to relax_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) .
 We tried_(UnrelEv) several ways of resting_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) but after a few minutes we would get_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) and reposition_(UnrelEv) ourselves .
 The ride was_(UnrelEv) nice overall though because the conductor would stop_(RelNScrEv) every four hours or so to allow_(UnrelEv) for bathroom breaks and food purchases at the stops .
 We took_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) night_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) so the majority of the time we would not able to enjoy_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the view out of the window but when daylight broke_(UnrelEv) and we were able to see_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) outside it made_(UnrelEv) the trip go_(UnrelEv) by_(UnrelEv) quicker .

 My family decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) in to the city and have_(UnrelEv) an afternoon of shopping_(UnrelEv) .
 We went_(ScrEv_get_train_station) to the station and bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) tickets from the vending machine there .
 We often bought_(ScrEv_get_tickets) the ten-trip ticket because it was_(UnrelEv) a good bargain .
 Then we had to wait_(ScrEv_wait) for our train to arrive_(ScrEv_train_arrives) .
 When it did_(UnrelEv) , we stepped_(ScrEv_get_on) through the open doors into the car , stepping_(ScrEv_get_on) carefully over the gap between the platform and the train .
 We found_(ScrEv_find_place) ourselves a nice seat .
 My sister took_(ScrEv_find_place) a seat by the window because she always likes_(UnrelEv) to watch_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the moving_(RelNScrEv) landscape .
 We all enjoyed_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) a train ride .
 The sound of the wheels on the tracks was soothing_(UnrelEv) and the rides were_(UnrelEv) n't too long .
 Before long , the conductor came_(RelNScrEv) and took_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) our tickets .
 She was_(UnrelEv) very polite and friendly .
 It was_(UnrelEv) not long before the train went_(RelNScrEv) into the tunnel and we knew_(UnrelEv) the ride was_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) nearly over .

 Last summer , I decided_(UnrelEv) I wanted_(UnrelEv) to visit_(UnrelEv) some family and friends of mine whom resided_(UnrelEv) on the other side of the country .
 I carefully considered_(UnrelEv) my travel options and expenses , and decided_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) most economical to take_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) .
 Traveling_(Evoking) by_(Evoking) train_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) an easy and straight forward experience , but is_(UnrelEv) also fun and enjoyable .
 To begin_(UnrelEv) , I visited_(RelNScrEv) the railroad 's website and booked_(ScrEv_get_tickets) my ticket .
 The ticket was then sent_(RelNScrEv) to me via email , which I could print_(ScrEv_get_tickets) out_(ScrEv_get_tickets) or display_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) on my mobile device .
 On the day of travel , I arrived_(ScrEv_get_train_station) at the train station about a half an hour early and waited_(ScrEv_wait) for the train to arrive_(ScrEv_train_arrives) .
 When the train arrived_(ScrEv_train_arrives) , the conductor stepped_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) and asked_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) for tickets .
 I had elected_(UnrelEv) to use_(RelNScrEv) my mobile device to display_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) my ticket , so I showed_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) the ticket to the conductor and he scanned_(ScrEv_conductor_checks) it with his phone .
 I was then directed_(ScrEv_find_place) towards my assigned_(RelNScrEv) seat .
 I settled_(ScrEv_find_place) in_(ScrEv_find_place) for the ride , with food and entertainment I had brought_(RelNScrEv) with me .
 For most of the ride however , I was glued_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) to the window , enjoying_(ScrEv_spend_time_train) the sights of town after town that we traveled_(RelNScrEv) through .
 The next day I arrived_(ScrEv_arrive_destination) at my destination .
 I gathered_(RelNScrEv) my bags and stepped_(ScrEv_get_off) off_(ScrEv_get_off) the train , knowing_(UnrelEv) I would return_(RelNScrEv) again very soon .

 I wanted_(UnrelEv) to find_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree that would last_(UnrelEv) a quite long time .
 We found_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a nice pine tree that was_(UnrelEv) just large enough to be_(UnrelEv) a foot .
 We dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a nice hole in the ground , and insured_(UnrelEv) the soil was_(UnrelEv) the proper type to accept_(UnrelEv) a tree of this size .
 It had to be_(UnrelEv) nice and soft , and in a safe location where kids wo n't trample_(UnrelEv) over it .
 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole about 4 '' '' deep and insured_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) wide enough for the tree .
 We planted_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree and began_(UnrelEv) to fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in the surrounding area of it with soil to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it would hold_(UnrelEv) in place as perfect as possible .

 My friend , Tom , had moved_(UnrelEv) into a new house , and decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) small_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) to help_(UnrelEv) make_(UnrelEv) his yard look_(UnrelEv) better .
 He had been advised_(RelNScrEv) by a tree expert , that the best time to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) in April or May .
 So about several weeks after Tom had moved_(UnrelEv) into his new home , he went_(UnrelEv) ahead_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in mid April .
 He first got_(UnrelEv) and checked_(UnrelEv) some maps to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) he did n't mistakenly end_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) into any telephone or gas lines .
 Once he found_(ScrEv_find_place) a suitable spot to plant_(Evoking) his_(Evoking) new_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) , Tom took_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel and began_(UnrelEv) preparing_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole to place_(ScrEv_place_root) it in .
 Next , he prepared_(RelNScrEv) the tree for planting_(Evoking) by turning_(RelNScrEv) carefully upside down to remove_(RelNScrEv) it from the pot it came_(UnrelEv) in .
 He then gently , placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree into the hole .
 Tom also filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole with some compost and manure to help_(UnrelEv) the tree grow_(RelNScrEv) better .
 Once this was_(UnrelEv) done , he filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) up the hole completely and watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree .
 Finally , he placed_(RelNScrEv) mulch on top and then stopped_(UnrelEv) to admire_(UnrelEv) the beautiful new tree in his yard .

 We then went_(ScrEv_take_home) into my backyard and begun_(UnrelEv) to did_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole .
 We got_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole to about halfway the size we wanted_(UnrelEv) it and decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(RelNScrEv) a_(RelNScrEv) break for lemonade .
 Next we continued digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , all the while I am contemplating_(UnrelEv) the small part in ensuring_(UnrelEv) an Eco friendly future .
 As the sweat pours_(UnrelEv) down my face we finish_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole .
 Me and bob gently place_(ScrEv_place_root) the small tree in the hole .

 I checked_(UnrelEv) to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) okay to plant_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 Since my parents were_(UnrelEv) the land-owners , they said_(UnrelEv) yes .
 I made_(ScrEv_find_place) sure_(ScrEv_find_place) to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) far away from the house and any piper or wires .
 That way , when it grew_(RelNScrEv) larger , it would not be_(UnrelEv) dangerous .
 I decided_(ScrEv_choose_tree) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) pine_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 They are_(UnrelEv) not as messy in the fall , because they have_(UnrelEv) needles that they keep_(UnrelEv) instead of leaves that they shed_(UnrelEv) .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a small sapling at a store .
 Growing_(RelNScrEv) a tree from a seed is_(UnrelEv) more difficult .
 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in the ground wide enough to hold_(RelNScrEv) the roots well and about 4 inches deep .
 I gently removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the tree from its container and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it into the hole .

 I then gently placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole and then filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole back up with the dirt .
 The next thing I did_(UnrelEv) was add_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) mulch around the area of the tree .
 Once the mulch was added_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) , I put_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) a stake in the ground and tied_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) it to the tree .
 This was_(UnrelEv) to hold_(RelNScrEv) the tree in place as it grows_(RelNScrEv) for the first year .

 I bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a tree from my local plant supply store .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a small sapling with only a few branches on it .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel out of my garage and found_(ScrEv_find_place) a good place for the tree next to my house .
 I began digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole with the shovel for a few minutes until the hole was_(UnrelEv) about one and a half feet deep .
 I set_(RelNScrEv) down the shovel , and removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the plastic wrap from the tree 's roots .
 I separated_(ScrEv_other) the roots and loosened_(ScrEv_other) them apart .
 I set_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree down into the hole , and used_(RelNScrEv) the shovel to fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in the space around the roots with dirt and fertilizer that would help_(UnrelEv) the tree grow_(RelNScrEv) better .
 Then , I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) a bag of mulch from out of the garage and spread_(ScrEv_other) some of it around the tree to help protect_(RelNScrEv) it from other invasive plants .
 I watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree with a watering can .

 Today I planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) a small evergreen tree that I had purchased_(ScrEv_get_tree) from a mail order company a few weeks before .
 Since it arrived_(ScrEv_other) just the day before , I had to plant_(RelNScrEv) it today , before it died_(RelNScrEv) .
 First I gathered_(ScrEv_get_tools) up all the things I would need .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my gloves , my shovel , my small trowel and my gardening apron , as well as some potting soil I had bought_(ScrEv_get_tools) from the store earlier in the week .
 I carried_(ScrEv_get_tools) all this to the spot I had picked_(ScrEv_find_place) out for my new tree .
 The first thing I did_(UnrelEv) when I arrived_(UnrelEv) at my spot was to take_(RelNScrEv) my shovel and dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole that was_(UnrelEv) 12 inches deep .
 Next , I took_(RelNScrEv) the tree and removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) that burlap sack that encased_(UnrelEv) the roots , and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole .
 I then used_(RelNScrEv) my small trowel to fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in the hole with the potting soil .
 After I was done_(UnrelEv) I used_(RelNScrEv) the large shovel to tamp_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the dirt down around the tree , to pack_(RelNScrEv) it tight so the tree would n't fall_(RelNScrEv) over .

 On the weekend I planted_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) apple_(Evoking) an_(Evoking) apple_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 first , I put_(ScrEv_get_tools) on_(ScrEv_get_tools) gardening gloves to protect_(UnrelEv) my hands .
 Next , I used_(UnrelEv) a small shovel to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in a patch of dirt in my backyard .
 I then took_(RelNScrEv) an apple seed and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it inside the hole .
 Next , I took_(RelNScrEv) the soil that I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) out_(ScrEv_dig_hole) earlier and placed_(ScrEv_refill_hole) it on top of the seed , creating_(UnrelEv) a thin layer of soil on top of the seed .
 I then took_(ScrEv_get_tools) my watering can over to the water hose and used_(UnrelEv) the hose to fill_(RelNScrEv) the can up with water .
 When the can was_(UnrelEv) full , I brought_(ScrEv_get_tools) it back over to the patch of dirt where the apple seed was planted_(Evoking) , and I gently poured_(ScrEv_water) the water from the watering can onto the patch of dirt , watering_(ScrEv_water) my newly-planted_(Unclear) apple seed .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) happily about how exciting it will be_(UnrelEv) when my tiny apple seed grows_(RelNScrEv) into a huge apple tree .

 I found_(ScrEv_get_tree) a beautiful little tree at the local nursery and brought_(ScrEv_get_tree) it home to plant_(Evoking) in my garden .
 I had already picked_(ScrEv_find_place) the spot it was to go_(ScrEv_find_place) , a place in the middle of my yard where it could get_(RelNScrEv) full sun .
 After gathering_(ScrEv_get_tools) the shovel and watering hose , and putting_(ScrEv_get_tools) on my gardening gloves , I set to work_(ScrEv_dig_hole) on digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole .
 I had to make_(UnrelEv) sure the hole was_(UnrelEv) deep enough to fit_(ScrEv_place_root) its roots comfortably .
 I dampened_(ScrEv_water) the soil in the hole with a little water .
 Once the hole was_(UnrelEv) ready , I laid_(RelNScrEv) the tree on its side and gently removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the pot from it .
 I placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the sapling into the hole and looked_(UnrelEv) to see_(UnrelEv) that the base of its trunk would be level_(RelNScrEv) with the ground , then began_(UnrelEv) scraping_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the soil back into the hole , over the roots .
 I tamped_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the soil down , so as to prevent_(RelNScrEv) any air pockets , and watered_(ScrEv_water) it once more .
 I think_(UnrelEv) this little tree will make_(UnrelEv) a wonderful addition to my yard !

 Yesterday I went_(ScrEv_other) to the nursery and bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a baby apple tree about three feet tall .
 I 've always loved_(UnrelEv) apple trees .
 I carried_(ScrEv_take_home) it home in my pickup truck .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_tools) my shovel from the shed and started_(UnrelEv) to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole out in the corner of my backyard .
 As I was shoveling_(ScrEv_dig_hole) I started_(UnrelEv) to hit_(RelNScrEv) some rocky soil , and I decided_(UnrelEv) to try_(UnrelEv) the other far back corner of my yard .
 The hole took_(RelNScrEv) about 45 minutes to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , and I was_(UnrelEv) exhausted_(UnrelEv) from the work and the heat .
 I was able to fit_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree perfectly into the hole and then took_(ScrEv_other) a break to drink_(UnrelEv) some lemonade .
 After about 15 minutes I started_(UnrelEv) to refill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt around the tree .
 After packing_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the dirt down , I saturated_(ScrEv_water) the ground around the tree with water .
 I hope_(UnrelEv) that the tree is_(UnrelEv) n't too shocked_(UnrelEv) and it actually lives_(UnrelEv) .

 Our back yard was_(UnrelEv) so bare , so we decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) to spruce_(UnrelEv) it up .
 We decided_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a nice apple tree would look_(UnrelEv) great , and give_(UnrelEv) us fresh fruit when it 's grown_(RelNScrEv) .
 First we went_(RelNScrEv) to the nursery and bough_(ScrEv_get_tree) an apple tree sapling .
 Then when we got_(ScrEv_take_home) home , we got_(UnrelEv) to work .
 We dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in the ground big enough for the sapling to be planted_(ScrEv_place_root) .
 Once we had_(UnrelEv) the hole ready , in went_(ScrEv_place_root) the sapling .
 We made_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) it was_(ScrEv_place_root) in_(ScrEv_place_root) deep enough and was standing_(RelNScrEv) straight up , then we put_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt back in around the sapling .
 We carefully patted_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the dirt down so it would hold_(RelNScrEv) the sapling nice and firm .
 Once we had done_(UnrelEv) that , we took_(ScrEv_get_tools) the garden hose and watered_(ScrEv_water) our new plant , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it had_(ScrEv_water) enough water , but not so much that the dirt would get_(RelNScrEv) too muddy and the sapling might be_(RelNScrEv) loose .
 Then we took_(UnrelEv) a step back and looked_(UnrelEv) at_(UnrelEv) what would eventually become_(UnrelEv) our new apple tree .

 I am_(UnrelEv) an avid gardener .
 I have_(UnrelEv) a large garden and lots of flower beds .
 But this year I wanted_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) some_(Evoking) small_(Evoking) fruit_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) in my garden .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to the nursery and picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) out_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a small dwarf apple tree I wanted_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) .
 The tree was_(UnrelEv) young and was_(UnrelEv) basically a very small trunk with two branches .
 I brought_(ScrEv_take_home) it home and read_(RelNScrEv) the instructions for planting_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 The whole I needed to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) was_(UnrelEv) 18 inches across and 1 foot deep .
 I used_(UnrelEv) my garden shovel to break_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the grass and dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole .
 I saved_(RelNScrEv) the dirt in my wheelbarrow to put_(ScrEv_refill_hole) back in the whole when I was_(UnrelEv) done .
 I put_(ScrEv_place_root) the small tree in the whole and filled_(ScrEv_water) the hole with water .
 When the water had saturated_(ScrEv_water) the earth I then shoveled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) thew leftover dirt back in the hole .
 I was finished_(UnrelEv) in about 15 mintes .
 I think_(UnrelEv) I will get_(ScrEv_get_tree) several more fruit trees to plant_(Evoking) .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very easy to do_(UnrelEv) .

 My husband always wanted_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a lemon tree because he loves_(UnrelEv) lemons .
 For his birthday we surprised_(Unclear) him with one .
 We went_(RelNScrEv) to the nursery and bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) the tree .
 We got_(RelNScrEv) it into the back of the truck and drove_(ScrEv_take_home) home .
 We got_(RelNScrEv) the tree into the back yard and he was very surprised_(UnrelEv) .
 We all pitched_(UnrelEv) in_(UnrelEv) and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) up_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a big circle of grass in the back yard .
 We dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a big hole and put_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in it .
 Using_(ScrEv_get_tools) shovels we filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) it in with some good purchased_(ScrEv_get_tools) dirt that the nursery recommended_(UnrelEv) .

 There are_(UnrelEv) many ways to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 One of the least expensive is_(UnrelEv) planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) bare_(Evoking) root_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 I had to chose_(ScrEv_choose_tree) the right tree for my area and my particular situation .
 My local nursery carries_(RelNScrEv) only plants suited_(UnrelEv) to our area , but since I bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) from a catalog I checked_(RelNScrEv) for suitability in a Sunset Garden Book .
 I also had to site_(ScrEv_find_place) the tree properly .
 It could n't be_(ScrEv_find_place) under power lines , and needed_(ScrEv_find_place) room to spread_(RelNScrEv) .
 I finally planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) magnolia_(Evoking) .
 It began_(UnrelEv) as a bare root tree , and it now flowers_(RelNScrEv) every early spring , even in our drought .
 First , I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a planting_(ScrEv_place_root) hole .
 The hole was_(UnrelEv) wider at the bottom than at the top , and had_(UnrelEv) a cone of firm soil in its center to support_(RelNScrEv) the tree .
 The hole was_(UnrelEv) about five times as wide across as the tree .
 I started_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole with a shovel , but finished_(ScrEv_dig_hole) by hacking_(ScrEv_dig_hole) at the soil underground with a spade to undercut_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole and so the roots could get_(RelNScrEv) purchase when they started_(UnrelEv) to spread_(RelNScrEv) .
 I set_(ScrEv_place_root) the bare root tree on the cone I left_(UnrelEv) in the center of the hole and spread_(ScrEv_place_root) out its roots over the cone .
 I arranged_(ScrEv_place_root) the roots so the tree would be_(UnrelEv) level , no roots would be exposed_(RelNScrEv) , and the upper bark would n't be buried_(RelNScrEv) .
 Then I nearly filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole with soil , firming_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) it lightly by patting_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) it as I went_(UnrelEv) .
 When the hole was_(UnrelEv) almost full , I watered_(ScrEv_water) slowly , holding_(RelNScrEv) the tree straight as the water soaked_(ScrEv_water) in_(ScrEv_water) .
 Then I filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) up_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole completely .
 finally , I made_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) a ring of soil around the tree , to hold_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) water when the rainy season ended_(UnrelEv) and I would have to irrigate_(ScrEv_water) .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) no fertilizer or amendments when I planted_(Evoking) , because our sandy soil is_(UnrelEv) fairly fertile , and I did n't want_(UnrelEv) to make_(RelNScrEv) a dividing_(UnrelEv) line that would encourage_(UnrelEv) the tree to grow_(RelNScrEv) only in its tiny pothole of enriched_(RelNScrEv) soil .
 I wanted_(UnrelEv) it to spread_(RelNScrEv) its roots , and it has_(UnrelEv) .

 Now that winter is_(UnrelEv) over , our planting_(RelNScrEv) season has begun_(UnrelEv) .
 Last weekend , I went_(UnrelEv) out and bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a small apple tree .
 I found_(ScrEv_find_place) a perfect spot in my back yard for it .
 First I looked_(UnrelEv) around and decided_(UnrelEv) even if it grew_(RelNScrEv) very large , it would n't run_(RelNScrEv) into any other trees or power lines .
 Next I got_(RelNScrEv) to work with my tiller , cutting_(ScrEv_other) into the earth and churning_(ScrEv_other) up the dirt .
 Once everything was_(UnrelEv) loosened , I took my shovel and dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole .
 I gently placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the small young tree into that spot , burying_(RelNScrEv) it 's roots in the hole I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 I added_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) some coffee grounds to the soil around the roots , and then took_(RelNScrEv) my shovel and got_(UnrelEv) to work covering_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the roots up again .
 Finally , I smoothed_(RelNScrEv) the dirt with my shovel and went_(UnrelEv) to get my garden hose .
 A new tree needs_(RelNScrEv) water !
 I watered_(ScrEv_water) the ground beneath ot .
 Smiling , I admired_(UnrelEv) the small but sturdy tree in my yard that will someday be_(UnrelEv) a large tree that gives_(RelNScrEv) us fruit .

 Then I went_(ScrEv_other) to Home depot to pick_(ScrEv_choose_tree) out the tree .
 I know_(UnrelEv) nothing about trees , so I had_(UnrelEv) the employee at Home Depot help_(RelNScrEv) me .

 One that would n't need_(UnrelEv) much work or upkeep .
 Then she showed_(RelNScrEv) me what else I would need_(RelNScrEv) for the tree .
 I bought_(ScrEv_get_tools) soil and a shovel .
 We went_(ScrEv_take_home) to the park where we were planting_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole for the tree .
 After we place_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree and put_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) in the supports , we filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole back in , packing_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the soil tight .
 We said_(UnrelEv) a few words and watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree .

 Planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) a wonderful thing you can do_(UnrelEv) for your community and your environment .

 Fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in some fresh soil or even compost made_(UnrelEv) from old rotting leaves and grass clippings .
 This will help_(UnrelEv) fertilize_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) the tree and if you want_(UnrelEv) you can add_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) some fertilizer .
 Cover_(ScrEv_refill_hole) it up and make_(UnrelEv) a small ring around the base of the tree to help_(UnrelEv) catch_(RelNScrEv) water .

 My yard was_(UnrelEv) very bare and plain-looking_(UnrelEv) so I decided_(UnrelEv) to add_(UnrelEv) some trees to the landscape .

 They gave_(UnrelEv) me some ideas and I picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) out_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a Bradford pear tree sapling .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_home) it home and left_(UnrelEv) it in shade while I prepared_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 First I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a deep enough hole to cover_(UnrelEv) the whole root ball of the tree .
 Then I placed_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) some fertilizer in the bottom of the hole .
 Next I unwrapped_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the root ball from the burlap sack which contained_(UnrelEv) it and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it in the hole that I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 Once it was_(UnrelEv) in , I shoveled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt back into the opening and tamped_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) it firmly around the base of the tree .
 After that I placed_(ScrEv_get_tools) a soaker hose near it to give_(ScrEv_water) it plenty of water .

 My parents had purchased_(ScrEv_get_tree) a new lemon tree that they wanted_(UnrelEv) to plant_(RelNScrEv) , so I went_(UnrelEv) to their house to help_(UnrelEv) them plant_(RelNScrEv) it .
 My dad already had a place picked_(ScrEv_find_place) out to put_(RelNScrEv) the tree , so we went_(RelNScrEv) to work .
 We had to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a fairly large hole and it took_(RelNScrEv) several hours .
 We had to take_(ScrEv_other) a break half way through because it was_(UnrelEv) rather tiring .
 After the water break , we finished_(UnrelEv) digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) and we tested_(ScrEv_other) the depth by setting_(ScrEv_place_root) the bundled_(RelNScrEv) roots into the hole to make_(UnrelEv) sure that it was_(UnrelEv) deep enough .
 Since it was , I added_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) some of the nutrient rich soil additives into the bottom of the hole and my dad watered_(ScrEv_water) the soil additives with the garden hose .
 We then cut_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the burlap off that had covered_(RelNScrEv) the roots and carefully set_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree into the hole .
 We took_(ScrEv_other) another break and then set_(UnrelEv) in to refilling_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole with dirt .
 It took_(RelNScrEv) a long time to do_(UnrelEv) , but it was_(UnrelEv) well worth it .
 I left_(UnrelEv) the hose turned_(RelNScrEv) on at the base of the tree so that it could get_(UnrelEv) properly soaked_(RelNScrEv) and we went_(UnrelEv) back into the house to properly cool_(UnrelEv) off .

 It is_(UnrelEv) a day where we recognize_(UnrelEv) the environment and the fact that we need to protect_(UnrelEv) it .
 This earth day my friend Patrick and I decided_(UnrelEv) that we should plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) to counteract_(UnrelEv) the effects of deforesting_(UnrelEv) .
 To do this we first dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in the ground twice the size of the root ball of the tree .
 It was_(UnrelEv) hard work , but it ensures_(UnrelEv) that the tree has_(RelNScrEv) enough loose soil to spread_(RelNScrEv) its roots in .
 We then placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the middle of the pit we had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) and made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it was centered_(RelNScrEv) .
 After that we filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the rest of the pit with a high quality planting soil in order to give_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) the tree proper nutrition .
 After the soil was placed_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in_(ScrEv_refill_hole) we stepped_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) on the soil to compact_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) it and make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the tree stays_(RelNScrEv) in place .
 It felt_(UnrelEv) really good to give_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) to the environment instead of damaging_(UnrelEv) it .

 It was_(UnrelEv) in last spring , when we were taking_(UnrelEv) photos by standing_(UnrelEv) in front of our house , we felt_(UnrelEv) like our photos lacked_(UnrelEv) something .
 Later we reached_(UnrelEv) a conclusion that we do n't have_(UnrelEv) enough green around our house .
 So we thought_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) nice if we plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) our_(Evoking) yard_(Evoking) .
 So we started_(UnrelEv) our search on trees .
 During summer time a lot of rabbits come_(UnrelEv) to our house and destroy_(UnrelEv) all plants .
 Therefore we are_(UnrelEv) in need of a plant that should n't attract_(UnrelEv) rabbits .
 We read_(RelNScrEv) reviews of different types of trees .
 At last we reached_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a conclusion to buy a maple tree so that we can enjoy_(UnrelEv) fall too .
 We were_(UnrelEv) new to planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) , so we watched_(RelNScrEv) some videos to get_(RelNScrEv) some information .
 In one website they suggested_(RelNScrEv) to plant_(RelNScrEv) a somewhat tall plant rather than a small plant .
 So we went_(UnrelEv) to Home Depot bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a plant and a shovel .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a very beautiful maple tree .
 After reaching_(UnrelEv) home I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a pit just to fit_(RelNScrEv) the plant base which was packed_(RelNScrEv) with some soil .
 Me and my wife held_(ScrEv_other) it and kept_(ScrEv_other) the plant in to the pit and removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the plastic sheets which wrapped_(RelNScrEv) the plant base together with the soil .
 After that we poured_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the soil back to the pit and made_(UnrelEv) the plant to stand_(RelNScrEv) straight .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a please experience .

 I decided_(UnrelEv) one day to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in my front yard .
 I was_(UnrelEv) unsure of what sort of tree I should plant_(Evoking) so I went_(UnrelEv) online and did_(UnrelEv) research as to which type of tree would be_(UnrelEv) best for my situation .
 I settled_(ScrEv_choose_tree) on a magnificent Norway Pine , as it is_(UnrelEv) common in Northern Minnesota .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) to my nearest greenhouse , which I found_(UnrelEv) via Google Maps , and asked_(RelNScrEv) them where they kept_(RelNScrEv) their saplings -LRB- as I had read_(UnrelEv) that this is_(UnrelEv) how one should plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) -RRB- .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_tree) the sapling and brought_(ScrEv_take_home) it home with me .
 It was_(UnrelEv) only six inches high but I knew_(UnrelEv) I could make_(UnrelEv) it grow_(RelNScrEv) tall and strong .
 I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel and started_(UnrelEv) to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , one small hole the size of the pot the sapling was_(UnrelEv) in .
 I carefully took_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the sapling out of the pot and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it into the freshly dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) hole .
 Filling_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the empty parts of the hole with extra dirt , I marveled_(UnrelEv) at my creation .
 That was_(UnrelEv) the day I planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in my front yard .

 Planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) was_(UnrelEv) one of the most difficult but memorable experiences of my life .
 When I decided_(UnrelEv) I wanted_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) I knew_(UnrelEv) absolutely nothing about it , so my first step was_(UnrelEv) to do_(RelNScrEv) some research .
 As it turns_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) , while it is_(UnrelEv) possible to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) from a seed , trees are most commonly planted_(Evoking) in the for of saplings : small baby trees that come_(UnrelEv) in pots .
 So I went_(RelNScrEv) to the Home Depot and picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree .
 I decided_(ScrEv_choose_tree) on an avocado tree because I love_(UnrelEv) the buttery goodness of its fruit .
 I carefully packed_(RelNScrEv) the tree into my car and took_(ScrEv_get_tree) it home , where I brought_(RelNScrEv) it into my backyard and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole for it .
 After I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole , I took_(RelNScrEv) the sapling out of the pot and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it into the hole .
 Finally I filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) up the excess space with leftover dirt and gave_(ScrEv_water) the tree a water in its new home .

 Yesterday I planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 First I went_(RelNScrEv) to a nursery .
 A nursery is_(UnrelEv) a place where they have_(UnrelEv) , flowers , plants , shrubs and trees .
 I chose_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a sapling - a young tree - paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) for it and put_(ScrEv_get_tree) in in the back of my pickup truck .
 When I got_(ScrEv_take_home) home_(ScrEv_take_home) I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel out of my shed and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole where I wanted_(ScrEv_find_place) to tree to grow_(RelNScrEv) , making_(ScrEv_find_place) sure_(ScrEv_find_place) it was_(UnrelEv) n't too near my house .
 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole about two feet deep , a little bigger than the root ball on the bottom of my tree .
 Once I had the hole dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , I dropped_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in , making_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) the trunk was_(UnrelEv) straight .
 I cut_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the burlap surrounding_(RelNScrEv) the root ball , and then filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the space around the tree with the dirt I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) out earlier .
 Finally , I grabbed_(ScrEv_get_tools) a garden hose and watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to give_(UnrelEv) it a good soaking_(ScrEv_water) .
 The tree should give_(UnrelEv) us pleasure for years to come_(UnrelEv) .

 First we began_(UnrelEv) by going_(ScrEv_other) to the orchard and picking_(ScrEv_choose_tree) the best tree we could find_(ScrEv_choose_tree) , this however did not satisfy_(UnrelEv) the little ones so we had to go_(ScrEv_get_tree) with the tree that they picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) out .
 We drove_(ScrEv_take_home) back home with the tree on top of the car to begin_(UnrelEv) the planting_(RelNScrEv) .
 Starting_(UnrelEv) off I dug_(RelNScrEv) a medium sized_(RelNScrEv) hole where we could plant_(RelNScrEv) the tree and it could grow_(RelNScrEv) as much as it wanted_(UnrelEv) .
 We fertilized_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) the ground where the tree would be planted_(RelNScrEv) and began_(UnrelEv) the transfer of the tree .
 This tree was then checked_(ScrEv_other) daily on its progress and to be watered_(ScrEv_water) .
 The tree 's health was_(UnrelEv) a priority of our family and we kept_(RelNScrEv) it in spectacular condition .
 This tree now stands_(RelNScrEv) tall over our house to protect_(RelNScrEv) it from the sun and allow_(RelNScrEv) us the shade we need_(UnrelEv) when we would like_(UnrelEv) to play_(UnrelEv) outside .
 This tree is_(UnrelEv) the foundation of our family and we use_(UnrelEv) it to show_(UnrelEv) our togetherness .

 Earth day happens_(UnrelEv) every year on April 22 .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) something about it later year and went_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) this year .
 I wondered_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) to a local tree farm , and bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a sapling with a friend .
 We both borrowed_(UnrelEv) a friend 's pick up truck and drove_(ScrEv_take_home) to a place in the woods that we usually hang_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) at .
 While we arrived_(RelNScrEv) there , it was_(UnrelEv) beautiful weather for the beginning of Spring .
 We went_(RelNScrEv) off_(RelNScrEv) to the area where we always set_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) our tents when we go_(UnrelEv) camping_(UnrelEv) .
 We ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) near the campsite and removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the bag around the sapling .
 Carefully , we both picked_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the tree and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it in the hole we dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) and it fit_(ScrEv_place_root) in_(ScrEv_place_root) perfectly !
 After that I carefully held_(RelNScrEv) the tree in place while my friend filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole back with dirt .
 A year later , the tree is still growing_(RelNScrEv) in perfect health .

 Before you plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) , you must contact_(UnrelEv) the utility company .
 They will come_(UnrelEv) to your property and mark_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) utility lines .
 Without doing_(UnrelEv) this , you may dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) down_(ScrEv_dig_hole) and hit_(UnrelEv) a line , which can be_(UnrelEv) lethal !
 Once you know_(UnrelEv) where to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , select_(ScrEv_choose_tree) what type of tree you want_(UnrelEv) .
 Take_(UnrelEv) things into consideration such as how much sun it gets_(UnrelEv) , what zone you are_(UnrelEv) in , and how quickly you want_(UnrelEv) it to grow_(RelNScrEv) .
 Dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole large enough for the tree and roots .
 Place_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole and then fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole back up with dirt .
 Many small trees will need_(UnrelEv) support until they are_(UnrelEv) bigger .
 This will ensure_(UnrelEv) they grow_(RelNScrEv) tall and straight .
 It is_(UnrelEv) crucial to keep_(UnrelEv) the tree watered_(ScrEv_water) !
 It will need_(UnrelEv) a lot of water at first .
 Mulch is_(UnrelEv) helpful to keep_(UnrelEv) the soil moist .
 It 's_(UnrelEv) also important to wait_(UnrelEv) until the threat of a frost has passed_(UnrelEv) or is_(UnrelEv) not in the near future .
 Giving_(UnrelEv) care to your new tree will ensure_(UnrelEv) that it will grow_(RelNScrEv) big and strong !

 On Arbor Day this year , I decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) new_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in my front yard .
 I went_(UnrelEv) out and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole where_(ScrEv_find_place) I decided_(ScrEv_find_place) the tree would go_(RelNScrEv) , and I kept_(RelNScrEv) the dirt I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) up off to the side for easy access to replant_(RelNScrEv) with .
 I got_(UnrelEv) in my car and drove_(UnrelEv) to the local nursery to look_(ScrEv_choose_tree) at trees .
 I had_(UnrelEv) an idea of what I wanted_(UnrelEv) in mind , but they had_(UnrelEv) so many different trees when I got_(UnrelEv) there that I had_(UnrelEv) a very hard time deciding_(ScrEv_choose_tree) .
 Finally , I just decided_(ScrEv_choose_tree) to go_(UnrelEv) with_(UnrelEv) the tree I had originally planned_(UnrelEv) to purchase_(ScrEv_get_tree) .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to the cashier and paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) for the tree and loaded_(ScrEv_other) it in my truck to drive_(UnrelEv) home .
 Once I got_(UnrelEv) home , I brought_(ScrEv_other) the tree out to the spot in my yard where I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole .
 I unwrapped_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the bottom of the tree that had been wrapped_(RelNScrEv) up to prevent_(UnrelEv) a mess , and I placed_(ScrEv_find_place) it in the dirt .
 I packed_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) up around the bottom of the tree to keep_(UnrelEv) it secure , and I watered_(ScrEv_water) it and tied_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) some stakes up to keep_(UnrelEv) the tree level and upright .
 That 's how I planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .

 Hmmmm I do n't know_(UnrelEv) Jenny '' '' he replied_(UnrelEv) . ''
 `` We need to decide_(ScrEv_choose_tree) what we will want_(RelNScrEv) the tree for . '' ''
 Jenny tilted_(UnrelEv) her small head and asked_(UnrelEv) '' `` What do you mean_(UnrelEv) Grandpa ?
 What can trees do_(UnrelEv) ? '' ''
 Trees can do_(UnrelEv) many things , provide_(UnrelEv) shade , flowers or food just to name_(UnrelEv) a few .

 They decided_(UnrelEv) to take_(UnrelEv) a ride to a plant nursery to look_(ScrEv_choose_tree) at_(ScrEv_choose_tree) all the small young trees .
 Grandpa did not want_(ScrEv_choose_tree) the pine tree .
 Even though it would stay_(UnrelEv) green all year .
 He did not want_(ScrEv_choose_tree) the Lilac tree even though the flowers would smell_(UnrelEv) so pretty in each spring .
 Instead he picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a nice sized_(UnrelEv) apple tree .
 Jenny bounced_(UnrelEv) with excitement . ''
 `` Grandpa we can pick_(UnrelEv) apples soon ? '' ''
 she exclaimed_(UnrelEv) . ''
 `` Someday he said_(UnrelEv) smiling_(UnrelEv) down at her .
 Grandpa brought_(ScrEv_get_tree) the tree to the cashier and paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) the fee for their tree and carefully loaded_(ScrEv_take_home) it into the back of his truck .
 At home grandpa got_(ScrEv_get_tools) the tools they would need_(RelNScrEv) from his little gardening shed .
 A hose , watering can , shovel , two pairs of gardening gloves and a tiny shovel just right for Jenny 's helping_(RelNScrEv) hands .
 After putting_(ScrEv_get_tools) on_(ScrEv_get_tools) their gardening gloves together they dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole five times larger than the root ball of the tree they had paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) for_(ScrEv_get_tree) at the nursery .
 Grandpa gently turned_(RelNScrEv) the small tree upside down to remove_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) it from the pot it had been growing_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) .
 He told_(UnrelEv) Jenny it was_(UnrelEv) important to now plant_(ScrEv_place_root) the small tree right away so it 's tender rooms did not dry_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) .
 He placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the roots into the hole they has dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) and made_(RelNScrEv) sure_(RelNScrEv) the top of the root ball was_(UnrelEv) level with the ground and that they tree was standing_(RelNScrEv) straight and tall .
 Together they filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the rest of the hole around the trees roots .
 Jenny helped_(RelNScrEv) grandpa filled_(ScrEv_water) the watering can with water from the hose and she watched_(RelNScrEv) proudly as grandpa watered_(ScrEv_water) their newly planted_(Evoking) apple tree .

 In the late spring , I bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a beautiful little tree from a nursery .
 The workers there helped_(UnrelEv) me find_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a type of tree that would grow_(RelNScrEv) tall and give_(RelNScrEv) good shade in the summer .
 When I went_(ScrEv_take_home) home , I thought_(ScrEv_find_place) about the best place in my backyard to put_(RelNScrEv) the tree .
 The tree 's roots were tied_(RelNScrEv) up in a little bag with some potting soil to give_(ScrEv_water) it water and nutrients for a little while , but it had to be put_(RelNScrEv) in the ground soon to keep_(UnrelEv) it healthy .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to my garden shed and got_(ScrEv_get_tools) some tools so I could plant_(RelNScrEv) it as soon as possible .
 First I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) a big wheelbarrow to help_(UnrelEv) me carry_(ScrEv_get_tools) everything I needed .
 In the wheelbarrow , I put_(ScrEv_other) the little tree , a shovel , a big watering can , and a garden rake .
 Then I pushed_(ScrEv_other) it to the spot in my yard that I wanted to put_(RelNScrEv) the tree .
 I took_(ScrEv_other) the tree and all the tools out of the wheelbarrow , except for the shovel .
 Then I pushed_(UnrelEv) my wheelbarrow to my compost bin at the other side of my garden .
 I one by one , I scooped_(ScrEv_other) a shovelful of compost into my wheelbarrow until there was_(UnrelEv) enough to fill_(UnrelEv) a couple of buckets .
 The compost would help_(RelNScrEv) the tree get_(UnrelEv) a head start on growing_(RelNScrEv) tall and healthy .
 I pushed_(ScrEv_other) the wheelbarrow back to where I wanted to plant_(RelNScrEv) the tree .
 Next , I had to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole so the tree would be_(UnrelEv) secure in the ground .
 I stuck_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the tip of the shovel in the ground and pushed_(ScrEv_dig_hole) down hard on it with my foot .
 The ground gave_(UnrelEv) way , and I was able to scoop_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the dirt out of the way .
 I did_(ScrEv_dig_hole) this until I had a round hole over two feet deep .
 I put_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole , but it would not stand_(RelNScrEv) up straight , and instead leaned_(RelNScrEv) on one side of the hole .
 I slowly scooped_(ScrEv_refill_hole) compost and dirt into the hole , carefully adjusting_(ScrEv_other) the tree to stand_(RelNScrEv) upright again after each shovelful .
 I patted_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the earth down to keep_(UnrelEv) it compact .
 After a lot of hard work , the hole was finally filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) with dirt and compost , and the tree was standing_(RelNScrEv) upright and strong .
 I smoothed_(ScrEv_other) over the dirt and compost with my garden rake , then filled_(ScrEv_other) up the watering can with water from a hose .
 I slowly poured_(ScrEv_water) the water over the freshly raked_(RelNScrEv) dirt , letting_(UnrelEv) the water soak_(UnrelEv) into the ground .
 The tree was planted_(RelNScrEv) and ready to grow_(RelNScrEv) !

 One day I decided_(UnrelEv) that my backyard was missing_(UnrelEv) something .
 I walked_(UnrelEv) around_(UnrelEv) in my backyard and decided_(UnrelEv) that a tree would go_(UnrelEv) perfectly in the corner .

 I brought_(RelNScrEv) the tree into the backyard and set_(RelNScrEv) it down .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) my shovel and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a large enough hole for the tree .
 I placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole and filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) it in with dirt .

 I bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a little flowering_(UnrelEv) tree at a local greenhouse .
 It came_(ScrEv_get_tree) with its roots bundled_(UnrelEv) up in burlap , or something that looks_(UnrelEv) like burlap .
 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole about two feet deep in my front yard , where I wanted_(UnrelEv) the tree to grow_(RelNScrEv) .
 The instructions said_(UnrelEv) to leave_(UnrelEv) the roots in the bag .
 The bag would naturally rot_(UnrelEv) away_(UnrelEv) with time and the roots would poke_(UnrelEv) out of it as they grew_(RelNScrEv) .
 Once my hole was dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , I moved_(RelNScrEv) the tree over to the spot and put_(ScrEv_place_root) it in the hole .
 I then started_(UnrelEv) filling_(ScrEv_refill_hole) up_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole I 'd made_(ScrEv_dig_hole) with the dirt that I 'd dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) up_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the tree was standing_(UnrelEv) straight and I tamped_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) down_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the loose dirt by walking_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) on it until the tree seemed_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) firmly in place .
 I then put_(RelNScrEv) some mulch around the base of the tree in a circle .
 That 's supposed_(UnrelEv) to help_(UnrelEv) the area retain_(UnrelEv) moisture , which the tree needs_(UnrelEv) to survive_(UnrelEv) .
 After that , I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) the hose and watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree a little to give_(UnrelEv) it a good start in life .

 The first step to planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) is to find_(ScrEv_find_place) a suitable spot for the tree .

 make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) there are_(UnrelEv) know power-lines or other objects that may be affected_(UnrelEv) the growing_(RelNScrEv) tree .
 After a suitable spot is found_(ScrEv_find_place) , get_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel and dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a whole large enough to cover_(UnrelEv) the entire base off the tree with at least six inches of soil to spare_(UnrelEv) on top of the trees root bulb .
 When the hole is dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , shake_(RelNScrEv) some of the loose dirt from the tree 's root bulb and then place_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree into the newly created_(ScrEv_dig_hole) hole .
 Pack_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the area around the hole and tree bulb with some of the dirt that was excavated_(ScrEv_dig_hole) from the hole .

 Planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) a very difficult task .
 First , I went_(RelNScrEv) to Walmart or another nursery in the area and pick_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree .
 When I get_(RelNScrEv) to_(RelNScrEv) Walmart , I asked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) the cashier for which trees are_(UnrelEv) easiest to take_(RelNScrEv) care because I can not take_(RelNScrEv) care of plants very well .
 Then I figured_(ScrEv_choose_tree) out_(ScrEv_choose_tree) whether I want_(UnrelEv) a tree for the sun or shade .
 When I picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree , I took_(ScrEv_get_tree) it to the cashier and paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) for it .
 Then I put_(ScrEv_take_home) the tree in the back of my car and went_(ScrEv_take_home) home .
 Next , when I got_(ScrEv_take_home) home , I took_(RelNScrEv) the tree outside and figured_(ScrEv_find_place) out_(ScrEv_find_place) where I wouldput_(ScrEv_place_root) it in the yard .
 Afterwards , I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a whole where the tree would go_(ScrEv_place_root) .
 The hole was_(UnrelEv) the size of the pot of the tree .
 Then I pulled_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the tree out of the pot and put_(ScrEv_place_root) the whole thing in the hole I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 Then , I covered_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the sides with more dirt and put_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) some fertilizer and water around the tree so it set_(RelNScrEv) in the ground .

 I travel_(RelNScrEv) to the local nursery to select_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree for planting_(Evoking) , today I have decided_(UnrelEv) to purchase_(ScrEv_get_tree) a flowering_(RelNScrEv) maple tree .
 I ensure_(UnrelEv) the one I pick_(ScrEv_choose_tree) is_(UnrelEv) high quality with no rotting_(RelNScrEv) and looks_(RelNScrEv) healthy .

 With my garden shovel I dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole at least twice the size of the roots of the tree .
 I ensure_(UnrelEv) rocks and are removed_(RelNScrEv) from the hole .
 I put_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) plenty of organic matter in the hole to ensure_(RelNScrEv) good growth .
 I gently place_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole and refill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) with the shoveled_(ScrEv_dig_hole) dirt .
 I place_(ScrEv_get_tools) my garden hose at the base of the tree and turn_(ScrEv_water) the water to a very slow stream so it will absorb_(RelNScrEv) into the soil properly .
 I allow_(UnrelEv) the water to run_(ScrEv_water) for about and hour ensuring_(UnrelEv) it does n't get_(RelNScrEv) soggy .
 I step_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) and admire_(UnrelEv) my new tree and envision_(UnrelEv) what it will look_(UnrelEv) like a year from now .

 It 's_(UnrelEv) spring time so I decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 I purchased_(ScrEv_get_tree) a small orange tree to go_(Unclear) in the back yard .
 First I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole where I wanted_(ScrEv_find_place) the tree .
 Then I shook_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the roots of the tree to loosen_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) them .
 Then I placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole .
 I used_(UnrelEv) a shovel to replace_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt back over the tree roots .
 Once satisfied_(UnrelEv) the tree was_(UnrelEv) firmly in the ground i dragged_(ScrEv_get_tools) over_(ScrEv_get_tools) the hose .
 New trees needs_(ScrEv_water) lots of water .
 I watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree until I was satisfied_(UnrelEv) and then put_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) mulch around the base .
 I also attached_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) ropes to secure_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) the young tree so it would n't fall_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) while it 's roots were still settling_(RelNScrEv) in_(RelNScrEv) .
 I also had_(UnrelEv) a canval funnel installed_(RelNScrEv) to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) water went_(ScrEv_water) right into the roots where it was need_(RelNScrEv) most .
 Once all was said_(UnrelEv) and done_(UnrelEv) i stepped_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) to admire_(UnrelEv) my handy work .

 First , you need to pick_(ScrEv_find_place) out where you want to put_(RelNScrEv) your tree .
 You 're going to be digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) quite a large hole , so you need to consider_(RelNScrEv) a few things .
 First of all , make_(UnrelEv) sure you place_(RelNScrEv) your tree where it wo n't mess_(UnrelEv) anything up as it grows_(RelNScrEv) .
 You want to put_(RelNScrEv) it somewhere where it has_(UnrelEv) plenty of room to grow_(RelNScrEv) , with soft dirt .
 Next , you need to gather_(ScrEv_get_tree) the tree you 're going to plant_(RelNScrEv) as well as a shovel .
 Then you 're going to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a nice big hole .
 You want the entire roots of the tree to be covered_(UnrelEv) sufficiently in dirt , so make_(UnrelEv) sure it 's_(UnrelEv) plenty big enough .
 Next , you place_(ScrEv_place_root) your tree in it 's hole .
 Position_(ScrEv_other) it properly .
 Make_(UnrelEv) sure it 's got_(UnrelEv) plenty of room .
 Finally , you can fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in dirt around your tree .
 Now you 're finished_(UnrelEv) and you can watch_(UnrelEv) your tree grow_(RelNScrEv) !
 Soon you 'll have_(UnrelEv) a nice big tree to shade_(RelNScrEv) you !

 When I was_(UnrelEv) a freshman in high school we each had_(UnrelEv) the opportunity to buy_(ScrEv_get_tree) an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday .
 Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) more_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) in town .
 The tree I had_(UnrelEv) was_(UnrelEv) some kind of evergreen tree and I planned_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) in the front yard .
 I asked_(UnrelEv) my Dad where it 'd be best to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) and we picked_(ScrEv_find_place) a spot where there were_(UnrelEv) some flowers , but no trees .
 In order to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) I read_(RelNScrEv) the instructions that came_(UnrelEv) with the tree and started_(UnrelEv) by digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole that was_(UnrelEv) about twice the size of the root ball of the tree .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a small tree so this was_(UnrelEv) not a big hole .
 I then tried_(UnrelEv) to make_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole a good shape before putting_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in_(ScrEv_refill_hole) some moss and fill dirt .
 I watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree that day and made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to water_(ScrEv_water) it each day for about a week until we had_(UnrelEv) a good rain .
 The tree grew_(RelNScrEv) and became_(UnrelEv) quite large .
 The one thing I did n't realize_(UnrelEv) is that I should have planned_(UnrelEv) better for how big the tree was going to get_(UnrelEv) because it ended_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) shadowing_(UnrelEv) over the flower planters a bit .

 Every year we celebrate_(UnrelEv) Arbor Day .
 Last year we we decided_(UnrelEv) to celebrate_(UnrelEv) the holiday by planing_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 We went_(RelNScrEv) to the local plant nursery .
 We talked_(RelNScrEv) to the employees to find_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) which trees grow_(RelNScrEv) well in our area and in the type of soil we have_(UnrelEv) .
 We chose_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a small maple seedling .
 When we got_(ScrEv_take_home) home , we chose_(ScrEv_find_place) an area of our yard with lots of sun .
 We dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole just a little bigger than the roots of our seedling .
 We put_(ScrEv_place_root) the seedling in the hole in the ground very carefully , then covered_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the roots with dirt .
 We patted_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the dirt down really good to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the little tree seedling would be_(UnrelEv) stable in the ground when it was_(UnrelEv) windy .
 Then we watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree .
 We 've been watching_(UnrelEv) and watering_(ScrEv_water) our tree for a year and slowly but surely our little tree is growing_(RelNScrEv) .

 I love_(UnrelEv) cherries .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) it would nice if I had_(UnrelEv) a cherry tree in my backyard .
 There was_(UnrelEv) plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) one_(Evoking) .
 I drove_(RelNScrEv) my pickup truck to a nursery near where I live_(UnrelEv) .
 They had_(UnrelEv) many different types of trees there , all growing_(RelNScrEv) in large pots .
 The trees were_(UnrelEv) very skinny , but I knew_(UnrelEv) once they were_(UnrelEv) out of the pots and planted_(ScrEv_place_root) in the ground , they would grow_(RelNScrEv) into large trees .
 I found_(ScrEv_choose_tree) some cherry trees and saw_(UnrelEv) how much they would cost_(RelNScrEv) .
 I asked_(RelNScrEv) a man who worked_(UnrelEv) at the nursery if he would put_(RelNScrEv) the tree in my pickup after I paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) for it .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to the cashier and paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) for the tree and the man loaded_(ScrEv_get_tree) it into my truck .
 When I got_(ScrEv_take_home) home , I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow_(RelNScrEv) .
 I made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left_(UnrelEv) in the hole .
 I added_(ScrEv_refill_hole) some manure so the roots would get_(UnrelEv) all the extra nutrients a growing_(RelNScrEv) tree would need_(UnrelEv) .
 In the middle of the hole I made_(UnrelEv) the soil higher in the shape of an upside down cone .
 I took_(RelNScrEv) the tree out of my truck and removed_(RelNScrEv) it from the pot .
 I stood_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread_(UnrelEv) out around it .
 This would make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the tree would not be standing_(UnrelEv) in water and the roots could drink_(UnrelEv) the water easily .
 I replaced_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the tree was_(UnrelEv) even with the ground around the hole .
 When the hole was all filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) up_(ScrEv_refill_hole) I stomped_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) all around the tree to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the roots of the tree were_(UnrelEv) firmly connected_(UnrelEv) with the soil .
 When I was_(UnrelEv) sure the tree was_(UnrelEv) firmly in the ground and would not move_(UnrelEv) , I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my garden hose .
 I turned_(RelNScrEv) on_(RelNScrEv) the water and slowly watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree .
 After a few hours , I watered_(ScrEv_water) it again .
 When all the water had sunk_(UnrelEv) into the ground , I put_(RelNScrEv) a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep_(UnrelEv) the roots moist and stop_(UnrelEv) weeds from growing_(UnrelEv) .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that I would have to water_(ScrEv_water) the the tree every week until the roots got established_(UnrelEv) .
 The tree will get_(UnrelEv) bigger every year , and I 'm looking_(UnrelEv) forward_(UnrelEv) to the day when I 'll be able to pick_(UnrelEv) cherries in my own back yard !

 This winter , my family and I decided_(UnrelEv) we wanted_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in our backyard .
 Since it was_(UnrelEv) still the middle of winter , we decided_(UnrelEv) to wait_(UnrelEv) until it was_(UnrelEv) April to plant_(Evoking) it because we learned_(UnrelEv) that was_(UnrelEv) the best time of year to do_(Unclear) it .
 Once April came_(UnrelEv) around , we chose_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a suitable tree for our area .
 With a shovel , we dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole that had_(UnrelEv) enough room for the fresh roots to grow_(RelNScrEv) .
 After that was done_(Unclear) , we prepared_(ScrEv_get_tree) the tree by gently taking_(ScrEv_get_tree) it out of the pot .
 Once our tree was_(UnrelEv) ready , we placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it into our freshly dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) hole .
 Once the tree was properly placed_(ScrEv_place_root) , we refilled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole with the dirt and soil so that it was_(RelNScrEv) securely in place .
 We were_(UnrelEv) happy to see_(UnrelEv) our tree all set_(RelNScrEv) and watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree .
 We plan_(UnrelEv) to enjoy_(UnrelEv) watching_(UnrelEv) the tree grow_(RelNScrEv) for many years .

 I have actually planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) few_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) in my day .
 I helped my mom plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) few_(Evoking) fruit_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) that she had bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) .
 Interestingly enough , we never leave_(RelNScrEv) them in the pot , but we never put_(ScrEv_place_root) them in the ground dirt either .
 We start_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) by digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a pretty deep hole .
 Depending_(UnrelEv) on the size of the tree and the roots , its_(UnrelEv) usually about a foot and a half deep and about a foot wide .
 we then put_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) soft planting soil in the bottom to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) that the tree will have_(RelNScrEv) more nutrition .
 My mom also has_(UnrelEv) manure that she uses_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) sometimes , but I let_(UnrelEv) her handle_(UnrelEv) that one .
 After we have everything set_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) , we take_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the tree out of the pot , and gently spread_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) out_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the roots to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) they can grow_(RelNScrEv) with some more space .
 Then we stick_(ScrEv_place_root) in in the hole , and put_(ScrEv_refill_hole) more dirt and whatever around it and gently pack_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) it in .
 After all that , we find_(ScrEv_get_tools) a stake of some sort and tie_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) it next to the tree so it has_(UnrelEv) something to keep_(RelNScrEv) it upright while it grows_(RelNScrEv) .

 I went_(Unclear) out to my backyard with the appropriate tools needed_(RelNScrEv) to plant_(Evoking) my tree .
 I was planning_(ScrEv_choose_tree) on planting_(Evoking) an orange tree as I could harvest_(RelNScrEv) the oranges once they become_(RelNScrEv) ripe .
 I started_(UnrelEv) digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) into the soil where my old tree used to be_(UnrelEv) -LRB- but was unfortunately torn_(RelNScrEv) down as a result of old age and danger of power lines , but I got_(ScrEv_other) the clear to plant_(Evoking) another tree if I had wished_(UnrelEv) -RRB- .
 I then planted_(Evoking) my several orange tree seeds into the ground , and started_(UnrelEv) covering_(ScrEv_refill_hole) them with dirt again .
 I tilled_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the dirt over and around the planted_(Evoking) seeds to smooth_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) out the surface .
 I then took_(ScrEv_get_tools) my garden hose and watered_(ScrEv_water) the area for about ten to fifteen minutes .
 Once I was done_(UnrelEv) with watering_(ScrEv_water) , I made_(UnrelEv) sure the seeds did not get flooded_(RelNScrEv) to the surface of the soil as a result of my watering_(ScrEv_water) , to which I noticed_(UnrelEv) they had been finely secured_(RelNScrEv) underground .

 We agreed_(ScrEv_find_place) on_(ScrEv_find_place) her backyard , since my house does not have_(UnrelEv) much of a yard .
 When we got_(ScrEv_take_home) to_(ScrEv_take_home) her house , we found_(ScrEv_find_place) a perfect place in the corner of her backyard .
 We grabbed_(ScrEv_get_tools) our shovels and began_(UnrelEv) to roughen_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the sides and bottom of where we were planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) , so that the root tips can penetrate_(RelNScrEv) the soil .
 Then we created_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) a water basin with mulch and filled_(ScrEv_water) the basin with water .

 I had never planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) before , so before we planted_(Evoking) one , I had to do_(UnrelEv) a lot of research .
 I had to look_(ScrEv_choose_tree) up what kind of tree would work_(UnrelEv) best in my climate .
 I had to see_(UnrelEv) which ones needed_(RelNScrEv) certain levels of care , look_(ScrEv_choose_tree) up different tree diseases , and the prices of some trees .
 I had to find_(ScrEv_choose_tree) something that would work_(UnrelEv) well in my yard .
 When we finally picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a perfect tree , we had to take_(ScrEv_take_home) it home .
 It was_(UnrelEv) very heavy !
 Once we had_(ScrEv_get_tree) it home , we had to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a very big hole .
 After you roll_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree into the hole , you have to do_(UnrelEv) something called_(UnrelEv) facing_(RelNScrEv) the tree , which means_(UnrelEv) you put_(ScrEv_other) the tree in the position you are_(UnrelEv) happy with the already existing_(UnrelEv) branches growing_(RelNScrEv) .
 You do n't want_(UnrelEv) a huge branch going_(RelNScrEv) right toward your house !
 To make facing_(RelNScrEv) easier , you should fill_(ScrEv_water) the hole halfway with water before putting_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree inside .
 After you face_(RelNScrEv) the tree , fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in the dirt , and pat_(UnrelEv) yourself on the back for a job well done_(UnrelEv) .

 My family moved_(UnrelEv) into a new house and we wanted_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) year_(Evoking) to celebrate_(UnrelEv) our new beginning .

 We chose_(ScrEv_find_place) a spot in our yard where the tree would have_(UnrelEv) plenty of space to grow_(RelNScrEv) .
 My dad brought_(ScrEv_get_tools) out some shovels and we all helped_(RelNScrEv) to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a big hole .
 The tree was_(UnrelEv) not very large yet , but the ball of roots at the bottom made_(UnrelEv) it very heavy .
 We all helped_(RelNScrEv) Dad lift_(RelNScrEv) the tree and carry_(ScrEv_other) it over to the hole .
 We placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it in gently , being_(UnrelEv) very careful not to damage_(RelNScrEv) the roots or the branches .
 We threw_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) some fertilizer into the hole to feed_(RelNScrEv) the tree and then we started_(UnrelEv) to refill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole with the dirt we had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) out .
 We made_(UnrelEv) sure the tree was_(UnrelEv) nice and straight and standing_(RelNScrEv) tall and then began patting_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) down the dirt .

 As the days rolled_(UnrelEv) by_(UnrelEv) and the temperature flirted_(UnrelEv) with hospitable warmth I planned_(UnrelEv) the beginnings of a new spring garden .
 One of the new additions would be_(UnrelEv) a fruit tree .
 Given_(UnrelEv) the climate here in the south we are blessed_(UnrelEv) with an ability to have_(UnrelEv) both cold and warm types of trees to a certain degree .
 This would be_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a cold tolerant tree .
 I took_(RelNScrEv) an apple from some time ago that I had chilled_(RelNScrEv) seeds in the freezer for .
 The chilling_(RelNScrEv) of the seeds are supposed_(UnrelEv) to mimick natural coldness and bring_(UnrelEv) forth_(UnrelEv) the seed easier .
 I then prepared_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) the soil with fertilizer in a pot and planted_(ScrEv_place_root) the seed .

 Last year I planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) fig_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) with my grandfather .
 Ordinarily we would n't have to plant_(Evoking) a tree , but his old tree had died_(RelNScrEv) over the winter .
 We live_(UnrelEv) in kind of a cold climate so fig trees really do n't grow_(RelNScrEv) well here , and if they do_(Unclear) you usually wo n't get_(RelNScrEv) figs .
 They 're more often used_(RelNScrEv) as ornamental plants around here , but the trees my grandfather has_(UnrelEv) always produce_(RelNScrEv) figs .
 After we got_(RelNScrEv) rid of the old tree , we planted_(Evoking) the new one near where the old one had been_(UnrelEv) .
 The important thing about growing_(RelNScrEv) these kinds of trees in this area is getting them to survive_(RelNScrEv) the winter .
 What we did was we got_(ScrEv_get_tools) a bunch of maple leaves and some chicken wire fencing .
 We wrapped_(ScrEv_other) the chicken wire around the tree and stuffed_(ScrEv_other) the space between with the leaves .

 Yesterday , I noticed_(UnrelEv) my yard did not have_(UnrelEv) any shade , so I decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 First , I went_(RelNScrEv) to the garden store and bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a sapling ; a baby tree .
 I took_(ScrEv_take_home) the sapling home and surveyed_(ScrEv_find_place) my yard for the best place to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 I choose_(ScrEv_find_place) a sunny spot right in the middle of my backyard .
 I then took_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) into the earth at the spot I decided_(ScrEv_find_place) on_(ScrEv_find_place) .
 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a little hole in that area .
 I unwrapped_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the root of the sapling and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it in the small hole that I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 Then I used_(UnrelEv) a spade to fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt around the tree root , so that the roots were totally covered_(ScrEv_refill_hole) by dirt .
 I added_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) a little fertilizer in the dirt around the roots so that the tree would grow_(RelNScrEv) big and strong .
 I stepped_(RelNScrEv) back_(RelNScrEv) and looked_(RelNScrEv) at_(RelNScrEv) my new tree and was_(UnrelEv) so happy that the task was accomplished_(UnrelEv) .
 One day that sapling will grow_(RelNScrEv) into a large tree and provide_(UnrelEv) shade to my backyard .

 Last spring , I planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in my backyard .
 When I was_(UnrelEv) a kid , we always had_(UnrelEv) apples , because we had_(UnrelEv) two apple trees in our backyard .
 We used to make_(UnrelEv) pies and applesauce and I wanted_(UnrelEv) to have_(UnrelEv) that at my house .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_tree) to the local nursery and I found_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a 6 foot tree .
 With delivery , it was_(RelNScrEv) pretty expensive , but I figured_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) worth it .
 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) out an area in my backyard .
 I was surprised_(UnrelEv) at how long it took_(UnrelEv) and how much dirt that I had to move_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 Digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole took_(UnrelEv) me the longest time of the whole process .
 I finally got that done_(UnrelEv) and I stuck_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the ground .
 I read_(RelNScrEv) online about a fertilizer that was_(UnrelEv) good for apple trees and mixed_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) that in with the dirt as I was filling_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) in the area around the roots .
 I do n't expect_(UnrelEv) to get_(RelNScrEv) any apples this year and probably not next year , but the tree should be_(UnrelEv) mature enough to start_(UnrelEv) producing_(RelNScrEv) apples in the following_(UnrelEv) years .

 I was tempted_(UnrelEv) to even buy_(ScrEv_get_tree) a fruit plant , but decided_(UnrelEv) to save_(UnrelEv) my money and buy_(ScrEv_get_tree) that another time .
 What particularly took_(ScrEv_choose_tree) my interest was_(UnrelEv) a young oak sapling that was hiding_(UnrelEv) in the back behind all the potted_(UnrelEv) flowers .
 I did n't have_(UnrelEv) any oak trees in my yard , and to be_(UnrelEv) honest neither did_(UnrelEv) anyone in my neighborhood .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) a fantastic idea to introduce_(Unclear) this tree to my front yard .
 So I paid_(ScrEv_get_tree) the $ 15 for the young sapling and prepared_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) next to my driveway .
 To begin_(UnrelEv) , I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) a small shovel from my garage and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) out_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a 1 foot diameter and 1 foot deep circular hole .
 I picked_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) any rocks that were remaining_(UnrelEv) in the hole , removed_(RelNScrEv) any surrounding_(UnrelEv) weeds .
 Then I removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the tree from its temporary pot and put_(ScrEv_place_root) it and the nutrient-filled_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) soil it came_(UnrelEv) in_(UnrelEv) into the hole I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) out_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 Then filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the rest of the hole with dirt , gave_(ScrEv_water) the plant a little water , and waited_(UnrelEv) for it to grow_(RelNScrEv) into a big healthy tree .

 My backyard was looking_(UnrelEv) a little empty , so I decided_(UnrelEv) I would plant_(Evoking) something_(Evoking) in it .
 I decided_(ScrEv_choose_tree) on_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree .
 I went_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) and bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) some tree seeds .
 I picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a species that I thought_(UnrelEv) would grow_(RelNScrEv) well in the sun since my back yard receives_(UnrelEv) a lot of sunlight .
 Once I was_(ScrEv_take_home) back_(ScrEv_take_home) home , I brought_(ScrEv_get_tools) out_(ScrEv_get_tools) all my gardening tools .
 I found_(ScrEv_get_tools) a shovel and a watering can .
 With my seeds and tools , I found_(ScrEv_find_place) a spot in my yard that looked_(UnrelEv) like it would get_(RelNScrEv) enough sunshine .
 There , I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole for the seeds .
 I put_(ScrEv_place_root) a few in , and covered_(ScrEv_refill_hole) dirt back on top .
 After that I patted_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the the mound of earth back down .
 Once that was done_(UnrelEv) , I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) my watering can and watered_(ScrEv_water) the seeds until the soil was_(ScrEv_water) fairly moist .
 After that , I went_(UnrelEv) to put_(ScrEv_other) away_(ScrEv_other) gardening supplies .
 I planned_(UnrelEv) to water_(ScrEv_water) my tree periodically .
 I knew_(UnrelEv) that if I took_(ScrEv_water) good care of it , it would grow_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) to be_(UnrelEv) a full-sized tree .

 A few blocks from my home they are putting_(UnrelEv) in a small park and playground for the children in the neighborhood .
 The community has raised_(UnrelEv) money to purchase_(UnrelEv) playground equipment and plant_(Evoking) some_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) in the park .
 The playground is_(UnrelEv) nearly complete and all the is_(UnrelEv) left to do_(UnrelEv) is some landscaping_(UnrelEv) and get_(UnrelEv) the trees planted_(Evoking) .
 The trees arrived_(ScrEv_other) with their roots all covered_(RelNScrEv) in burlap , the roots of these small trees are_(UnrelEv) actually quite large .
 The city has loaned_(ScrEv_get_tools) us a small backhoe so we can dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the appropriate sized_(RelNScrEv) holes for the new trees and help_(UnrelEv) move_(ScrEv_other) them into position .
 The operator has dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) dole that 's_(UnrelEv) about twice the size of the root ball and it takes_(UnrelEv) about three people to hold_(RelNScrEv) and steady_(RelNScrEv) the tree in the hole as they fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in each one using_(RelNScrEv) the backhoe .
 We plant_(RelNScrEv) about 10 trees in one afternoon .
 As the sun starts_(UnrelEv) to set_(UnrelEv) we have planted_(Evoking) water_(ScrEv_water) and fertilized_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) all the trees for the park .
 The trees are_(UnrelEv) beautiful and in a few years will provide_(RelNScrEv) shade to many areas of the park .

 Last Fourth of July we had_(UnrelEv) a nice family dinner outside .
 Unfortunately the sun was_(UnrelEv) so hot and we had nothing to provide_(UnrelEv) us shade .
 This year I wanted_(UnrelEv) to do something different so I decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) right where the table was_(UnrelEv) outside .
 Maybe this year we would have_(UnrelEv) some shade to keep_(UnrelEv) us cool .
 I went_(ScrEv_other) to the local farmer , farmer Jack and asked_(RelNScrEv) him if he could help_(RelNScrEv) me out .
 He told_(UnrelEv) me that I would want_(UnrelEv) to grow_(RelNScrEv) a nice oak tree right by that table .
 He was able to give me some seeds to use_(RelNScrEv) so I could make_(UnrelEv) my plan happen_(UnrelEv) .
 I used_(RelNScrEv) a small gardening tool to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) up some dirt .
 I placed_(ScrEv_other) the seeds inside the dirt and then covered_(UnrelEv) it up again .
 I took_(ScrEv_get_tools) a watering can and filled_(RelNScrEv) it up with water from the hose .
 I watered_(ScrEv_water) the dirt where the seeds were_(UnrelEv) and did_(ScrEv_water) this every day without fail .
 I 've started_(UnrelEv) to see a tree sprouting_(RelNScrEv) and am excited_(UnrelEv) for Fourth of July to get_(UnrelEv) here .

 When I was_(UnrelEv) a child my elementary school got_(UnrelEv) a grant .
 -LRB- Actually I think_(UnrelEv) it may have been_(UnrelEv) a grant given_(UnrelEv) to the entire school district -RRB- .
 The grant was_(UnrelEv) for putting_(Evoking) in_(Evoking) new_(Evoking) shade_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) at the school .
 Of course I was_(UnrelEv) in fourth grade , so I was never really able_(UnrelEv) to benefit_(UnrelEv) from the new tree , as it probably took_(UnrelEv) five to 8 years to produce_(UnrelEv) any real shade .
 The school made_(UnrelEv) a big deal about the new trees , I think there were_(UnrelEv) 5 of them .
 The principal -LRB- and probably many other adults -RRB- met_(UnrelEv) to decide_(ScrEv_find_place) where to put_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) .
 Then there was_(UnrelEv) a contest to see_(UnrelEv) which classes got_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) them_(Evoking) .
 My class ` won_(UnrelEv) ' the chance and all of us in the class got_(UnrelEv) to take_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a scoop of dirt out , it was_(UnrelEv) of course a mess .
 Then a landscaper came_(RelNScrEv) , quickly fixed_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the hole , set_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in and let_(UnrelEv) all of the kids who wanted_(UnrelEv) to put_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the dirt back around the tree by hand .
 It was_(UnrelEv) messy work and he constantly told_(UnrelEv) us not to push_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) down_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) on the dirt .
 Then he put_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) in_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) 3 stakes to hold_(RelNScrEv) the tree up and we watered_(ScrEv_water) it .
 I being_(UnrelEv) a child , promptly forgot_(UnrelEv) the tree and did not think_(UnrelEv) about it again for years , but when I went_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) to the school as a teenager -LRB- to play_(UnrelEv) on the swings -RRB- I remembered_(UnrelEv) and was surprised_(UnrelEv) how big it was_(UnrelEv) .
 Because the tree was_(UnrelEv) out in a large open play area it was_(UnrelEv) great that it provided_(UnrelEv) a lot of shade for the children at recess .

 My friend 's yard needed_(UnrelEv) some more shade to help_(UnrelEv) make_(UnrelEv) it cooler during the summer .
 We both decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) to help_(UnrelEv) with the problem .
 We went_(RelNScrEv) to the store and bought_(ScrEv_get_tree) a small tree that we could plant_(Evoking) and grow_(RelNScrEv) .
 We then took_(ScrEv_take_home) it home .
 The next step was_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) .
 We had to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) up_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in the backyard to plant_(Evoking) it_(Evoking) in .
 We used_(UnrelEv) shovels and a wheelbarrow to pick_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) the dirt and take_(RelNScrEv) it away .
 When the hole was_(UnrelEv) good enough , we planted_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole .
 We then made_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) to put_(ScrEv_refill_hole) back some of the dirt around the root and base of the tree to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) secure .
 After we were_(UnrelEv) sure the tree was_(UnrelEv) secure , my friend and I watered_(ScrEv_water) the area surrounding_(UnrelEv) it to make_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) it would grow_(RelNScrEv) properly .
 We hope_(UnrelEv) that the tree will offer_(UnrelEv) some shade by next summer .

 My neighborhood is kind of boring looking_(UnrelEv) since there are_(UnrelEv) n't many plants , I guess_(UnrelEv) you could say it looks_(UnrelEv) barren .
 One day I decided_(UnrelEv) to do_(UnrelEv) something about this , so I went_(RelNScrEv) to the local plant store with the intention of buying_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) I wanted_(UnrelEv) the tree to be functional rather than just cosmetic , so I decided_(ScrEv_choose_tree) to buy_(ScrEv_get_tree) a small apple tree .
 I brought_(ScrEv_take_home) the tree home and got_(UnrelEv) to work digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in my front yard with a shovel .
 It was_(UnrelEv) hard work and the weather was_(UnrelEv) hot , but finally the hole was_(RelNScrEv) big enough to plant_(RelNScrEv) the tree .
 I then carefully took_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the tree out of its pot and placed_(ScrEv_place_root) it in the hole .
 I filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole back up with dirt and made_(RelNScrEv) sure the tree was_(UnrelEv) steady .
 It was_(UnrelEv) a nice sight , some of my neighbors even complimented_(UnrelEv) me .
 I now water_(ScrEv_water) the tree every day to make_(UnrelEv) sure it grows_(RelNScrEv) strong .

 I planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) for Arbor Day last year .
 The first thing I did_(UnrelEv) was decide_(UnrelEv) where I want to plant_(Evoking) my_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) and I chose_(ScrEv_find_place) a nice spot in my backyard .
 Then I decided_(ScrEv_choose_tree) what kind of tree I wanted_(UnrelEv) .
 I thought_(UnrelEv) a shady tree would be_(UnrelEv) nice in that spot , so I went_(RelNScrEv) to a tree place called_(UnrelEv) a nursery and picked_(ScrEv_get_tree) out_(ScrEv_get_tree) a nice young tree called_(UnrelEv) a sapling and I loaded_(RelNScrEv) into the back of my truck to take_(ScrEv_take_home) home .
 Once I was_(UnrelEv) at home again , I got_(ScrEv_get_tools) my shovel and dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in the right spot in the backyard .
 Then I unwrapped_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) the trees roots and very , very carefully place_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree into the hole .
 The roots at the bottom are called_(UnrelEv) a root ball and is made_(UnrelEv) of the roots and dirt that protects_(UnrelEv) the roots .
 I was_(UnrelEv) very careful not to knock_(UnrelEv) the dirt off so the roots would n't be damaged_(UnrelEv) .
 Once the root ball was settled_(ScrEv_place_root) into the hole and the tree was standing_(RelNScrEv) up_(RelNScrEv) straight , I filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the hole up with dirt again and then watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree .
 My tree is_(UnrelEv) healthy and growing_(RelNScrEv) because I was_(UnrelEv) careful with it .

 When I was_(UnrelEv) very young , my family only just recently got_(UnrelEv) our new home .
 The backyard had_(UnrelEv) no trees and little decoration but that soon changed_(UnrelEv) over the years .
 About a year after we moved_(UnrelEv) in , my dad decided_(UnrelEv) it was_(UnrelEv) time we planted_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in the backyard and I was able to help_(RelNScrEv) .
 I had_(UnrelEv) no idea what type of tree it would be_(UnrelEv) and when I asked_(UnrelEv) my dad just said_(UnrelEv) I 'd have to wait_(UnrelEv) and find_(UnrelEv) out .
 I would n't know_(UnrelEv) it but several years later the tree would be_(UnrelEv) larger than the house itself .
 To get_(UnrelEv) things started_(UnrelEv) , I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) up a small hole to plant_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 My dad had to make_(UnrelEv) sure the hole was_(RelNScrEv) just the right size .
 Once the space was_(RelNScrEv) perfect , I carefully placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the very young tree into it 's new home and covered_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the roots up with dirt .
 After it was firmly set_(RelNScrEv) in place , I watered_(ScrEv_water) the tree and was done_(UnrelEv) for the day .

 Last year when I worked_(UnrelEv) for a friend doing_(UnrelEv) landscaping jobs , we often had to plant_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) .
 Generally , we would choose_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree from a near by plant store based_(UnrelEv) on what our customer desired_(UnrelEv) .
 Trees can be purchased_(ScrEv_get_tree) at all different ages , from very small to the size of a large pot .
 Then , after buying_(ScrEv_get_tree) the tree or trees , we would purchase_(ScrEv_other) mulch , or fertilizer , to give_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) the tree the proper nutrients so it can grow_(RelNScrEv) big and strong .
 After the tree and fertilizer is purchased_(ScrEv_get_tree) , we were_(UnrelEv) off the house to perform_(UnrelEv) our various activities .
 We lived_(UnrelEv) in a desert environment , so we first had to push_(ScrEv_other) all the rocks out of the way with either a rake , a hoe , or one of our other tools .
 After clearing_(ScrEv_other) the area in the yard for the tree , we then took_(ScrEv_get_tools) our shovels and started_(UnrelEv) digging_(ScrEv_dig_hole) away in the area chosen_(ScrEv_find_place) to plant_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) .
 We had to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) our hole big enough so that the entire bottom of the tree with roots and dirt fits_(RelNScrEv) snugly into the ground .
 After that is done_(UnrelEv) , we would fill_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) the hole with a mixture of mulch and the dirt we pulled_(ScrEv_get_tools) up when we first shoveled_(ScrEv_dig_hole) our hole open .
 After the tree has been firmly planted_(ScrEv_place_root) , we either had to turn_(ScrEv_water) on the sprinklers in the lawn , or find_(ScrEv_get_tools) the nearest hose and water_(ScrEv_water) the plants for about five to ten minutes .

 Last year we had_(UnrelEv) a fire .
 A large fire , that burned_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) homes and trees .
 I felt_(UnrelEv) lucky that my home had survived_(UnrelEv) , but the trees nearby had_(UnrelEv) not .
 I had just returned_(ScrEv_take_home) from a trip to the nursery where I had picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) out_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a couple of small fruit bearing saplings .
 One was_(UnrelEv) cherry , the other was_(UnrelEv) plum .
 Now they sit_(RelNScrEv) next to the car , along with a shovel .
 After some consideration , I pulled_(ScrEv_get_tools) on_(ScrEv_get_tools) my gloves and stepped_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) into the now barren area next to my house to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) two holes , approximately 20 feet apart .
 I wanted_(UnrelEv) to give_(RelNScrEv) them room to grow_(RelNScrEv) , yet close enough to have_(UnrelEv) company .
 This thought amused_(UnrelEv) me .
 I places_(ScrEv_place_root) each sapling into its hole , patting_(ScrEv_refill_hole) new earth around it in a mound .
 The I turned_(ScrEv_water) on_(ScrEv_water) the water hose , and gave_(ScrEv_water) them a good drink , tapping_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) down_(ScrEv_tamp_dirt) the new earth with the shovel . ''
 `` Welcome home '' '' I thought_(UnrelEv) , as I smiled_(UnrelEv) .

 It was_(UnrelEv) Arbor day and because of the occasion I decided_(UnrelEv) to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in my backyard .
 I figured_(UnrelEv) it would help_(RelNScrEv) the environment as well as be_(UnrelEv) an oxygen source and in a few years I could maybe cut_(UnrelEv) it down for firewood .
 I decided_(UnrelEv) to go_(RelNScrEv) down_(RelNScrEv) to my local Home Depot and buy_(ScrEv_get_tree) tree seeds and a shovel .
 I then went_(ScrEv_take_home) back_(ScrEv_take_home) to my house and started_(UnrelEv) uprooting_(ScrEv_dig_hole) the earth , creating_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a nice hole of dirt in which to plant_(ScrEv_place_root) my new tree .
 I got_(ScrEv_get_tree) the tree seed and planted_(ScrEv_place_root) it into the dirt and covered_(ScrEv_refill_hole) it into the ground .
 The good thing about trees are_(UnrelEv) they are_(UnrelEv) low maintenance and pretty self sufficient unlike other plants or flowers .
 I still watered_(ScrEv_water) it every day to get_(UnrelEv) it going_(RelNScrEv) and in a few years I will have_(UnrelEv) a large majestic oak tree to provide_(RelNScrEv) shade and a new home for birds and other wildlife .

 Planting_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) is_(UnrelEv) an important activity for most of us .
 We need_(UnrelEv) trees to survive_(UnrelEv) , and we need to replace_(RelNScrEv) the ones that are being cut_(UnrelEv) down_(UnrelEv) .
 To do_(UnrelEv) this , the right tools and location are_(UnrelEv) necessary .
 I would begin_(UnrelEv) by getting_(ScrEv_get_tree) the striplings from a local nursery , as well as the right mulch and shovel .
 Next I would find_(ScrEv_find_place) the right spot , somewhere with plenty of shade and also sunlight , where the roots can grow_(RelNScrEv) and not destroy_(RelNScrEv) a sidewalk or driveway .
 With the right location in mind , I would dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) down_(ScrEv_dig_hole) pretty deep , deep enough that it wo n't topple_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) or be dug_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) by passing_(UnrelEv) dogs or anything .
 Once the hole is dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , I can plant_(ScrEv_place_root) the stripling , fill_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the remainder of the hole with mulch and dirt and then attach_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) some type of thin but sturdy pole or stick next to the baby tree so that it will have something supporting_(ScrEv_tie_stakes_up) it until it grows_(RelNScrEv) strong and tall .

 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole wide and deep enough for the entire pot to fit_(UnrelEv) into , and I laid_(RelNScrEv) the pot on it 's side , gently tugging_(RelNScrEv) on the tree to remove_(RelNScrEv) it from the pot .
 Once it was_(UnrelEv) free , I shook_(RelNScrEv) the roots a little to free_(RelNScrEv) them up and planted_(ScrEv_place_root) the tree in the hole I had dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) .
 Then I packed_(ScrEv_refill_hole) the sides of the roots with the compost , making_(UnrelEv) sure_(UnrelEv) the trunk stayed_(UnrelEv) vertical as I was doing_(UnrelEv) this .
 When I had finished_(UnrelEv) I watered_(ScrEv_water) the new tree really well , making_(ScrEv_water) a puddle around the base of the trunk with my garden hose .
 Then it was_(UnrelEv) time to sit_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) and imagine_(UnrelEv) in a few years I would have_(UnrelEv) a big leafy red maple providing_(UnrelEv) lots of shade and color .

 A the church summer camp I volunteer_(UnrelEv) at it was decided_(UnrelEv) that we should try_(UnrelEv) to make the campus more sustainable as well as beautiful .
 Planting_(Evoking) fruit_(Evoking) bearing_(Evoking) trees_(Evoking) was thought_(UnrelEv) to be_(UnrelEv) a good way to achieve_(UnrelEv) these goals as well as letting_(UnrelEv) the participants learn_(UnrelEv) more about where food sources come_(UnrelEv) from .
 Research was done_(RelNScrEv) into finding_(ScrEv_choose_tree) trees that would bear_(RelNScrEv) fruit in the season that the camp was_(UnrelEv) most used .
 as well as having_(RelNScrEv) the requirements of water and sunlight and soil work_(UnrelEv) with the land at camp .
 Several trees were ordered_(ScrEv_get_tree) , including_(UnrelEv) a cherry tree .
 In the chosen_(RelNScrEv) location a hole was dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) and the tree had_(UnrelEv) the burlap removed_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) from the root ball and it was_(ScrEv_place_root) placed in at the appropriate depth .
 The soil with a few amendments was replaced_(ScrEv_refill_hole) and grass seed was sprinkled_(RelNScrEv) on .
 The tree was watered_(ScrEv_water) as suggested_(UnrelEv) and I was assigned_(UnrelEv) to schedule_(UnrelEv) future watering_(ScrEv_water) and monitor_(RelNScrEv) the tree for health and insect invasions .

 My husband and I went_(RelNScrEv) to the nursery to look_(ScrEv_choose_tree) at trees .
 We wanted to plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) in the front yard , but we were_(UnrelEv) n't sure what to get_(ScrEv_get_tree) yet .
 We wandered_(UnrelEv) through the nursery and considered_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a few of our option .
 We did n't want_(UnrelEv) a large tree , like a pine tree .
 We did n't want_(UnrelEv) a small tree , like a Japanese maple .
 We wanted_(UnrelEv) something in-between .
 When we spoke_(RelNScrEv) to one of the workers at the nursery , he suggested_(RelNScrEv) that we plant_(RelNScrEv) a crabapple .
 It would have_(UnrelEv) green leaves , and would have_(UnrelEv) white flowers in the spring .
 We took_(ScrEv_take_home) the tree home in the back of our truck .
 My husband used_(RelNScrEv) our shovel to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole in the ground .
 It took_(RelNScrEv) him some time - you have to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a pretty big hole when you plant_(Evoking) a_(Evoking) tree_(Evoking) !
 Then I helped_(RelNScrEv) him carry_(ScrEv_other) the tree over to the hole .
 We had to cut_(ScrEv_unwrap_root) off the plastic bucket it was_(UnrelEv) in .
 When we were done_(UnrelEv) , we put_(ScrEv_place_root) it in the hole , and I helped_(RelNScrEv) by holding_(RelNScrEv) the tree steady and pushing_(ScrEv_refill_hole) dirt into the hole .
 Once we had filled_(ScrEv_refill_hole) in all the dirt around the tree , we turned_(RelNScrEv) on the sprinklers .
 We wanted to water_(ScrEv_water) the tree and get_(UnrelEv) it off to a good start .
 We were excited_(UnrelEv) to have_(UnrelEv) a new tree in the front yard .

 In the morning , I woke_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) to prepare_(UnrelEv) for the day .
 After getting_(UnrelEv) coffee ready , I took_(UnrelEv) on breakfast .
 My partner awoke_(UnrelEv) , and she began_(UnrelEv) to get_(UnrelEv) ready_(UnrelEv) in the bathroom .
 She was_(UnrelEv) out_(UnrelEv) by the time food was_(UnrelEv) ready .
 We spoke_(UnrelEv) about our plans for the day , and what we intended_(UnrelEv) our goals to be_(UnrelEv) .
 After getting_(UnrelEv) dressed_(UnrelEv) up_(UnrelEv) to head_(UnrelEv) outside_(UnrelEv) , we headed_(RelNScrEv) over_(RelNScrEv) to the gardening store to choose_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a tree for our yard .
 Both of us were hoping_(ScrEv_choose_tree) for_(ScrEv_choose_tree) a nice Japanese Maple tree .
 The checkout lady was_(UnrelEv) nice , we found_(ScrEv_get_tree) exactly what we were looking_(RelNScrEv) for_(RelNScrEv) after we got_(RelNScrEv) into_(RelNScrEv) the store .
 Driving_(ScrEv_take_home) home , we could barely contain_(UnrelEv) our excitement .
 After stepping_(UnrelEv) back_(UnrelEv) in the house for a quick snack and another cup of coffee , we set_(RelNScrEv) out_(RelNScrEv) to the shed to get_(ScrEv_get_tools) the right tools .
 The hole was_(UnrelEv) easy to dig_(ScrEv_dig_hole) , and the tree was transplanted_(Evoking) successfully .

 Last weekend I thought_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) neat to make_(UnrelEv) my back yard more lively .
 I went_(ScrEv_get_tree) to the local landscaping store and picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) out some trees I thought_(UnrelEv) would look_(UnrelEv) nice in my yard .
 After returning_(UnrelEv) home I called_(UnrelEv) to my kids to come_(UnrelEv) help_(RelNScrEv) me install_(Evoking) the_(Evoking) new_(Evoking) plants_(Evoking) .
 We all grabbed_(ScrEv_get_tools) shovels , gloves , and buckets and went_(UnrelEv) to work .
 We dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) holes around the yard where we thought_(UnrelEv) it would be_(UnrelEv) nice to have the trees grow_(RelNScrEv) .
 We carefully each picked_(ScrEv_choose_tree) our favorite tree for each spot .
 Once we had settled_(ScrEv_find_place) on the location of each tree we set_(ScrEv_place_root) them in the holes and covered_(ScrEv_refill_hole) them back up with dirt .
 After placing_(ScrEv_place_fertilizers) some mulch around each tree to hold_(RelNScrEv) moisture it was time to water_(ScrEv_water) the plants .
 We were all pretty worn_(UnrelEv) out by this time so we played_(UnrelEv) rock , paper , scissors to determine_(UnrelEv) who would have to get_(ScrEv_get_tools) the hose and water_(ScrEv_water) the new trees .
 I ended_(UnrelEv) up losing_(UnrelEv) the game and was assigned_(UnrelEv) the task of watering_(ScrEv_water) .

 Unfortunately my poor dog just passed_(UnrelEv) away .
 He was_(UnrelEv) a good and loyal friend who never failed_(UnrelEv) to alert_(UnrelEv) me if someone came_(UnrelEv) on my property .
 As I was looking_(UnrelEv) upon his poor stiffening_(UnrelEv) body I could not find_(UnrelEv) a way to say_(UnrelEv) goodbye to such a great creature .
 Finally I decided_(UnrelEv) to bury_(UnrelEv) him in the front yard of the house he had so faithfully guarded_(UnrelEv) for many , many years .
 I went_(UnrelEv) to the store and purchased_(ScrEv_get_tree) a black cherry tree .
 I dug_(ScrEv_dig_hole) a hole and placed_(UnrelEv) his carefully and lovingly wrapped body in to the hole .
 I then placed_(ScrEv_place_root) the cherry tree on top of where he lay for eternal rest and watered_(ScrEv_water) it and staked_(ScrEv_other) it and placed_(RelNScrEv) a small fence around it .
 Now as the tree grows_(RelNScrEv) it will absorb_(UnrelEv) my frind and in a sense he will always be_(UnrelEv) there to watch_(UnrelEv) over my home and the yard he loved_(UnrelEv) to play_(UnrelEv) in .
