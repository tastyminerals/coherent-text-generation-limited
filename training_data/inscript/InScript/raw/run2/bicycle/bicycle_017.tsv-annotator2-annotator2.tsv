#text=Once I replaced the tire I flipped it back around to make sure that I had put it on correctly and once I had double checked that it was on correctly I started to ride my bike down the road to test the bicycle and the tire so that if there was something wrong with it I could figure it out now and not after in case I was in a situation , such as going down a hill , that it could be harmful to me in any way .
